0,Jalsa,4,A beautiful place to dine inThe interiors take you back to the Mughal era The lightings are just perfectWe went there on the occasion of Christmas and so they had only limited items available But the taste and service was not compromised at allThe only complaint is that the breads could have been betterWould surely like to come here again
1,Jalsa,4,"I was here for dinner with my family on a weekday The restaurant was completely empty Ambience is good with some good old hindi music Seating arrangement are good too We ordered masala papad panner and baby corn starters lemon and corrionder soup butter roti olive and chilli paratha Food was fresh and good service is good too Good for family hangout
Cheers"
2,Jalsa,2,Its a restaurant near to Banashankari BDA Me along with few of my office friends visited to have buffet but unfortunately they only provide veg buffet On inquiring they said this place is mostly visited by vegetarians Anyways we ordered ala carte items which took ages to come Food was ok ok Definitely not visiting anymore
3,Jalsa,4,We went here on a weekend and one of us had the buffet while two of us took Ala Carte Firstly the ambience and service of this place is great The buffet had a lot of items and the good was good We had a Pumpkin Halwa intm the dessert which was amazing Must try The kulchas are great here Cheers

Cheese chilli paratha with Bhutta palak methi curry is a good combo
Lemon Chicken in the starters is a must try item
Egg fried rice was also quite tasty
In the mocktails recommend Alice in Junoon Do not miss it"
7,Jalsa,4,You cant go wrong with Jalsa Never been a fan of their buffet and thus always order alacarte Service at times can be on the slower side but food is worth the wait
8,Jalsa,5,Overdelighted by the service and food provided at this place A royal and ethnic atmosphere builds a strong essence of being in India and also the quality and taste of food is truly authentic I would totally recommend to visit this place once
9,Jalsa,4,"The place is nice and comfortable Food wise all jalea outlets maintain a good standard The soya chaap was a standout dish Clearly one of trademark dish as per me and a must try

The only concern is the parking It very congested and limited to just 5cars The basement parking is very steep and makes it cumbersome"

12,Spice Elephant,4,Had been here for dinner with family Turned out to be a good choose suitable for all ages of people Can try this place We liked the most was their starters Service is good Prices are affordable Will recommend this restaurant for early dinner The place is little noisy
13,Spice Elephant,3,The ambience is really nice staff is courteous The price is pretty high for the quantity but overall the experience was fine The quality of food is nice but nothing extraordinary They also have buffetonly veg
14,Spice Elephant,3,I felt good is little expensive for the quantity they serve and In terms of taste is decent There is nothing much to talk about the ambience regular casual dining restaurant where you can take your family for dinner or lunch If they improve on that quantity or may be reduce the price a bit or may be improve the presentation of the food it might Manage to get more repeat customers
15,Spice Elephant,4,"I was looking for a quite place to spend some time with family and as well wanted to try some new place Since I was at Banashankari I thought of trying this place The place had good rating and was part of Zomato gold So I decided to try this place It was a delite to see a very friendly staff and food we ordered was very tasty as well

16,Spice Elephant,4,"Nice place to dine and has a good ambiance Food is good and the serving time is also goodneat restrooms and well arranged tablesonly thing is we went at 1230 for lunchand we noticed that they kept on playing one music back to back which was a little annoying

1 Chicken biriyani was so good and the chicken was fresh and tender rice was well cooked and overall was great

2 Mutton biriyani was very very good and tasty and It had plenty of mutton pieces"
17,Spice Elephant,5,"This place just cool  with good ambience and slow music and having delicious food is where you find peace Staff very friendly and they have maintained the place so clean The price is average for what the quantity of food they serve
Thom yum Thai soup was best and was treat to mouth roti was soft with that vilaythi paneer was perfect to have for veggie foodies in rice we tried burnt garlic fried rice with vegetables and it was the perfect thing to end"
18,Spice Elephant,4,Quiet a good family type of place too calm and usually we dont find crowd here panner curry and the deserts is what we had tasted they wer really good but we found it a little expensive
19,Spice Elephant,2,"I had a very bad experience here
I dont know about a la carte but the buffet was the worst They gave us complementary drink and momos before the buffet The momos were really good
The number of varieties first of all was very disappointing The service was very slow They refilled the food very slowly The starters were okay The main course also was so so There was two gravies with roti and some rice with raitha They had chats sev puri and pan puri which was average But the desert was disappointing They had gulab Jamun and chocolate cake The jamun was not cooked inside There was a cold blob of raw dough inside The chocolate cake also was really hard and not that good
Overall the buffet was a bad experience for me"

One of the good places to try north Indian foodbut depends on ur taste buds Not everyone will like all the items here Specially when u r particular abt sweet and spicy food
Theres buffet available too
We had ordered paneer uttar dakshin and paneer kurchanwas amazing The Gobi hara pyaz and mix veg were average"
21,Spice Elephant,3,A decent place for a family lunch or dinner well arranged in a simple manner Food was tasty and the crew was very helpful and understanding
22,Spice Elephant,4,"Great place to have a heavy lunch Good service
The chicken biryani was undoubtedly one of the best Ive had Biriyani and Lassi would be the suggested combo Buffet is the talk of the place so try according to your appetite A nice place"
23,Spice Elephant,4,Its the one restaurant near katriguppe that i found was really good Good variety of Chinese and thai dishes Service is good and good place to hangout with family as its a peaceful place where noise is really less and good view
24,Spice Elephant,2,"Spice elephant soup SPL almost manchow flavour soup Just above medium spicy

Lasooni fish tikka was awesome

I dont remember the dessert name but I have attached the photo  It had vanilla ice inside wafers Wafer was hell hard egg smell chewy  Nightmare dessert 

Table leg space was very bad I was so uncomfortable the whole time kept on adjusting my legs

No parking

For the taste felt this is too costly"
25,Spice Elephant,4,Zomato gold partner at this price It was insane They have really nice food small place with very courteous staff and very cheap food for this ambience Cost of soups is 80100 Starters from 150250 Main course 200300 Cost for two was 800 for us
26,San Churro Cafe,3,Ambience is not that good enough and its not a pocket friendly cafe and the quantity is not that good and desserts are too good enough 
27,San Churro Cafe,3,"Went there for a quick bite with friends
The ambience had more of corporate feel I would say it was unique
Tried nachos pasta churros and lasagne

Nachos were pathetic Seriously dont order
Pasta was okayish
Lasagne was good
Nutella churros were the best
Overall an okayish experience
Peace "
28,San Churro Cafe,4,"First of all a big thanks to the staff of this Cafe Very polite and courteous

I was there 15mins before their closing time Without any discomfort or hesitation the staff welcomed me with a warm smile and said theyre still open though they were preparing to close the cafe for the day

Quickly ordered the Thai green curry which is served with rice They got it for me within 10mins hot and freshly made

It was tasty with the taste of coconut milk Not very spicy it was mild spicy

I saw they had yummy looking dessert menu should go there to try them out

A good spacious place to hang out for coffee pastas pizza or Thai food"
29,San Churro Cafe,3,A place for people who love churos Otherwise its a normal simple cafe like any other in town  Can go and spend the evening there  The positive being it is one of the better cafes in and around Banashankari and also the place is not very crowded 
30,San Churro Cafe,3,Have been visiting this place since years The quality has gone down drastically Food quality has become very average from good Service is also very bad of late
31,San Churro Cafe,1,"Really disappointed with the place

Seems like a old dusty store room stacked up with old sofas and chairs The decor is soo disappointing that I cannot put it in words
Lastly the food was cherry on the cake to make it a complete worse meal

This place is the last option you should ever consider"
32,San Churro Cafe,3,"Congested atmosphere due to smoke from kitchen
Ambience was k
Service was k 
Churos was a new experience recommended
Near to kims  Parking was not der"
33,San Churro Cafe,1,"Cockroaches  I Repeat cockroachesBakasura was disappointed
Being in Banashankari being a gold outlet and nesting them who can even think of that Thankfully it wasnt over bakasuras plate The ambience was last cleaned a decade back i guess A cockroach just walked over our table As it was alive and well moving  the bakasura couldnt take a pic of it Then the staff had to actually take it out of our table Such ambience  like what are you upto

Bakasura disapproves I dont even want to talk about the food"
34,San Churro Cafe,4,"A nice place to hangout this place looks professional and also cute If anyone is trying churros for the first the time this is the place to go Cheesecake is pretty amazing too
Recommended"
35,San Churro Cafe,4,"1 pizza mocktails shakes and churros really very good
2 staff good
3 ambience simple and nice good
4 location of San churro cafe very nice
5 over San churro cafe good"
36,San Churro Cafe,3,"One of my favourite places that I often visit in South bangalore  but quality has been reduced than before Little unhappy with the food this time
But their churros never dissapointed me Staff are too slow and do not respond easily

Soups
Minestrone soup was like vegetable stock water with vegetables in it not happy with it

Churros 
It was great as usual A must visit place if u love churros

Starters
1 Africano panner 
It was bit sweet and not happy with the dish
2 Loaded nachos 
This happened to be their one of the best dishes but now I take back my words Very dissapointed with the dish

Main course
sicilia pizza
Pizza was too good its a must try dish

Finally I would recommend this place for churros and pizza

Hit chocolate and churro with chocolate dip in the picture

My first time at this restaurant and it has delivered in service options as well as taste"
40,San Churro Cafe,4,Though very sadly the place looks in need of retouching but the food was great Especially when it was super cold outside and we were super hungry the staff was nice We ordered the pink pasta and a pizza Both of them were pretty good Was really tempted to try their Churros but we were stuffed Worth a visit and try for sure
41,San Churro Cafe,3,Churros the restaurants eponymous offering has to be tried Theyre a Mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce Milkshakes are good too The interior walls have murals and writings all over Havent tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good
42,San Churro Cafe,3,Honestly have only tried parcels and that too only starters and mains  never tried desserts So this review is based on starters and mains only The quality wasnt all that great was pretty average
43,San Churro Cafe,4,"Visited this place for the first time recently The ambience was pretty good We ordered two churros for two Having churros for the first time ever I was way too excited and judgmental But swear to Lord the churros were heavenly The chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xD We had taken the Cross Country Ranch pizza It was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies
The place is famous for churros the name suggests so I would love to visit again to try all the other items out "
44,San Churro Cafe,4,"I love the desserts more than anything here Good place and well served 
We dint like the nachos here  it was not that good as we expected 
Except nachos almost all dish were quite good"
45,San Churro Cafe,2,2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined Churros was hard pizza was pathetic loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO Yes mayonnese Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other Thatll be my last visit San Churros
46,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,4,Great food and proper Karnataka style full meals Been there twice and was fully satisfied Will give 5 stars if its well managed
47,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,2,Reached the place at 3pm on Saturday Half of the items on the menu were over What was annoying was is the food was cold The taste was also very average Only dosa and holige were good There were very few people in the restaurant and the service was still very slow The waiters were all standing in one corner and talking Had to call them repeatedly
48,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,4,Had been here good food served and tastygood place to go with freinds and family should be first to get served well with all food One of the good hotel there for this price
49,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,2,How can a Udupi restaurant be so dirtythe floor the walls the waiters are all stained in foodWhy cant they clean it The floor even had decorative colour paper every where and lot of foodNow coming to the taste of the food it was pretty decent for what they chargwWhat upset us was the menu says they serve thambuli two variety of rice etc but they were all over at 245 but they still charged us full amountLastly if u r ok to b seated with random people and adjust with their table manners burrping etc then tis place is decent for a quick veg udupi meals
50,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,4,"Aadhuri Udupi bhojana is one of the best vegetarian hotel in and around Banashankari locality
were we can enjoy the authentic south Karnataka style food"
51,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,5,One of the best restaurants for unlimited food Price for one full unlimited meal is 150 and the service is awesome here If youre a costalian you will love the food served here
52,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,4,"Been here a couple of times Highly satisfying on both the ocassions Great food Decent service At price of 160 per person it is of a great value The staff here serves in a traditional Mysore style dresses The food is authentic Karnataka meals I really liked the pineapple picklechutney They serve some 4 varities of rice of which you shouldnt try all as you would already be full Roti Dosa were decent In the deserts Payasam Holige were good
I think it is one the must try places to try some authentic south food even if you have been to the likes of Kamath etc this one is a little different "
53,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,5,Very good restorent good south Indian food very nice all food s are good we spent good time and food in this hotel value of money we loved it
54,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,3.5,"I went to this restaurant on Sunday afternoonIt was a bit crowded

Its located in the 1st floor Above anna kuteera kathriguppe

57,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,1.5,The food was not satisfactory Not one item served could be eaten again  Only advantage is the price but even that is not going to be enough to make me visit the place again  Dear Udupi staff people wouldnt mind if the food quality was better for a higher price and please get more fans so that people wont have to deal with another disappointment of sweating while eating
58,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,5,Excellent quality and taste more variety of authentic south Indian food Excellent service Highly recommended Worth the money we pay here
59,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,2,Im rating 2 only because of the large number of items they serve for the price they charge While the taste is moderate the biggest turn off is the poor service and totally unresponsive staff They are either understaffed or poorly trained I didnt get to taste a few items thanks to their ever busy staff and ended eating what was served Please learn the crowd management from other peers like maiyya and roti ghar
60,Addhuri Udupi Bhojana,5,One of my colleagues suggested this place Went there at 1 pm and place wasnt crowded Ambience is decent and cool A welcome drink appekai saru was served Then startedtypical baale yele uta  Diffrerent types of palya kosambari and sides Then came masala dosa pulkapulav veg rice bath Masala dosa was very very tasty Service is bit fast as people will be coming but they will make it slow if u tell them to Then comes rice with sambarrasam daaltambali And yes dont forget to eat holigepayasam and icecream Service is very nice One best thing is all of this comes in just 160 rs and its unlimited What else you want A must visit place for south indian foodie

The starters are good and so were the pizzas
The prices are pretty affordable Must visit place "
87,Onesta,5,Very good pizza took unlimited pizza and could eat 3 pizzas easily per person even service is very good staff is very courteous and polite
88,Onesta,4,Onward has been a favourite place for a Pizza for quite some time Their Happy Hour Pizzas and Pizza Combos are to be relished The pizzas are fluffy and have just the right amount of sauce and toppings to cheer you up
89,Onesta,3,"Onesta serves unlimited pizza and desserts with pasta also
This places has multiple branches in the city and usually crowded on weekends
Service its good and decent
Prices  affordable
Food desserts and shakes are very good
But the pizzas are too thick base ones so until you order something very cheesy or with a generous topping cant taste it
The choclate banana pizza was a disappointment as was very raw"
90,Onesta,4,I like going back to this place I really like the ambience and the fact that it is a rooftop makes it a cool place to hangout Although I keep ordering almost the same thing every time it has always turned out to be a nice experience This place is famous for its pizza but I kinda like their pasta more Also the tiramisu shots are to die for and so is the mozzarella cheese balls with a really generous amount of cheese inside I would surely recommend this place and I would definitely keep going back
91,Onesta,5,"Bakasuras Paradise

The only place that can keep the bakasuras belly happy
My 6th visit and my 5th different onesta visit
From RR nagar JP Nagar Basavanagudi Koramangala bakasura ended up at an onesta in Banashankari as well
Every visit  its the unlimited meal that I have had But but but there is a change thats happening From unlimited pizza unlimited dessert and a beverage mocktails and everything to unlimited pizza one dessert and one aerated beverage cokePepsifanta  I have been through all And yet it never disappoints
The pizzas here are just fab and you can hardly eat like 45 pizzas in one sitting bakasura can can you Yes you can
Coming to the staff they are great
Coming to the quality its great

To finish
Be like onesta

Onesta Love"
92,Onesta,4,It is like any other onesta outlet But I find this outlet more crowded than any other outlet that I have visited so far Food wise its the same no much of difference But since the place a little huge service is delayed usually
93,Onesta,5,At times of a cafe bubble in Bangalore Onesta truly stands out as one the best restaurants with great food pocket friendly menu and excellent staff The place often has offers providing unlimited pizzas at prices as low as Rs 150 I have been here multiple times  tasted most of the items on menu and not once have I returned unsatisfied
94,Onesta,5,"This is one of the biggest Onesta outlets Ive visited In the last couple of years Onesta has made a name for itself We did not have pizza places that have a buffet option

Like any other Onesta the taste is right up there and the quick service I like the thin crust pizzas here Id recommend you to take the buffet ordering a la carte is not pocket friendly"
95,Onesta,5,"This roof top outlet of Onest  is one of the amazing places to have the best pizzas in and around Banashankari

Not only the ambience but also the cheerful yet humble service staff catalised my great experience there

So lets get over the food and the ambience first Restaurant is big with high roof give a sense of space well lit Food is great not mind blowing We took the unlimited menu and loved the bacon pizza most Rest of the pizza was good enough Among the deserts the walnut tart was superb but i didnt like the peanutbutter mousse at all

But in spite of all that the reason for the 5star rating is the service we got We were served by MrNanda who made us feel absolutely special He didnt have to We were a small party of just two people we werent ordering off the main menu and the restaurant discourages tips In spite of all that he was extremely attentive without being intrusive engaging and helpful I have been to quite some places from roadside ones to fivestar hotels rarely have the service been so heart warmingly good I hope he goes onto much much greater things in life because he is absolutely brilliant at his work"

Great pizza served hot and made to order They take note of what crusts you want for your pizza and I had the thin crust so I could eat more and the crust was made amazing also so was the pizza

It was superb crowd very good ser

129,Onesta,3,I love onesta always and their unlimited offers I had a really good experience in JP nagar but this outlet slightly disappointed me You guys took a lot of time for our orders and food was okayish too Hope you guys work on that
130,Onesta,3,This outlet of onesta is on the rooftop Its has a nice chill ambience Though the size of the pizzas are kinda small the ones with cream taste good They ran out of desserts by 9pm which was pretty disappointing The service was okay but can be improved

132,Penthouse Cafe,4,"Small cosy covered rooftop place provides just the right menu for quick bites as well as main course

The view is pretty in the evenings due to glass walls The ambience is good for a small gathering and hang out Not exactly the kind of place for fine dining

It doesnt seem to be like a popular hang out It is hard to even know if a cafe is existing there

Having Zomato gold membership works out well It was due to that we identified the place and went till there to utilise the benefit Thank you Zomato for the Gold  

We tried Veg Steak pasta pizza and sizzler
They provide thin crust pizza All the dishes were good and we enjoyed the food

Giving 4 because the service was slower than expected It could improve

All in all its a quiet place and food price is slightly on the higher side considering the ambience and quantity but its worth it since it tastes good One could give it a try"
133,Penthouse Cafe,4,Small cozy rooftop cafe with a wide spread menu Not the place for a huge gang Service is as expected Dishes to try are the range of pizzas Go to items like burgers and mocktails are also well prepared For a small place it has more than the required items on the menu So overall a pleasant experience

Ordered 2 chicken burgerswhich was really good
Service is great
Ambience is cool and fruit beer is alos available here"
136,Penthouse Cafe,2,"Penthouse Cafe is located in Banashankari Its on the 4th floor and is right opposite to Cafe Coffee Day on the main road First the place seems really shady The entrance is weird and you feel better only after ending up on the 4th floor
The place is really tiny and seems good Only thing that seemed nice about the place We had the Nachos cheese and salsa The mayo along with this was so runny and milky The cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didnt have any Next up my friend and I tried the pink sauce pasta The pasta was overcooked The sauce wasnt creamy at all It lacked in taste It had garlic bread along with it and it tasted decently But highly disappointed with this place I took my friend to this place with a lot of expectations and we were disappointed"
137,Penthouse Cafe,4,Situated in upper floor this cafe wasnt much known to me if I wouldnt find it in zomato It was bit early when we entered hence there were hardly 24 ppl in the cafe A small call place it was with light music We had ordered veg pasta BBQ chicken wings Peri Peri pizza All tasted good Pasta could be better Service was good
138,Penthouse Cafe,5,Best place to have food and a very friendly staffed cafe Price is very reasonable and the drinks are really really amazing  No comments of this cafe as everything was very goodthey also have a smoking zone
139,Penthouse Cafe,1,"Disappointing A friend of mine had told me its a below average cafe but I did not believe it looking at the ratings Visited myself today and he was right Masala tea was not even brewed and was made out of tea bags which was priced at 120 Rs Left it after two sips

Pesto Garlic bread was average but was priced at 200 Rs Virgin mojito tasted like it was just sweet sugar syrup with a hint of lime

Overall not worth the price being charged for the quality of food Not sure about their other food items as i did not even wanted to venture further when the tea arrived"

We ordered the Nachos Cheese Salsa BBQ Chicken Grilled Burger and the must try Jalapeno Cottage Cheese Burger

The Nachos were good and I loved the sauce they gave it with
The burgers where really sloppy but super filling in which the BBQ Chicken Grilled Burger was good quite similar to any other BBQ burgers
But the must try Jalapeno Cottage Cheese Burger is something I wouldnt recommend

Overall they have a great ambiance and an okayish food

211,Smacznego,4,A tuck shop in Banashankari slightly off the crowded Banashankari bda complex The menu is interestingand I had no complaints on the food as well While there is no wow factor in the dishes or the ingredients for sure no disappointment when tasted too Since it is in the concept of fast food they served in foil box unfortunately along with plastic spoon May be they need to immediately change to a wooden spoon We tried loaded fries and white sauce pastaboth were good Will be a good adda for college kids
212,Smacznego,5,Been here multiple times First visited a year back Their cheesy loaded nachos were really good Their waffles although takes a lot of time to make do taste quite yummy Even their white sauce pasta is nice And the prices are definitely worth the taste Service is pretty good too Love visiting this place
213,Smacznego,5,"Being in banashankari this has to be one of your must visit joints

Remember being in college and having all my gossip sessions here

Resonably priced friendly on the pocket this is the local hangout spot

Coming to the food they have amazing varieties of fries nachos and pasta

The owner and the staff is really sweet too and ice creams are amazing

Must try their bubble tea"
214,Smacznego,4,Our always go to place when in and around Banashankari I have been visiting this place since the past 25 to 3 yrs Over the period of time the quantity and quality has a slight dip The management is as friendly as always but i suggest them to revisit on the quality of the food Else it is a nice place to go to for a quick snack grab when hungry
215,Smacznego,4,"Yummy saucy fries Loved every bit of it  and worth the price  al the items on the menu were cheap and the quantity wasnt bad loved their mix of sauces 

And I also tried ordering from this shop online  and they reached on time and was packed very well I ordered mixed cream pasta it was really good"
216,Smacznego,4,Value for money everything they offer is amazing The fries are especially delicious and make for the perfect snack Been here a lot and tried almost everything they have to offer definitely worth it

225,Cafe Shuffle,1,Horrible Not even kidding We ordered BBQ chicken wings and chefs special pizza They gave undercooked chicken wings and the sauce on it was not even BBQ sauce It was some local sauce with little spices in it Pizza hardly had toppings on it Staffs were so irresponsible We had to tell them to give us the plates and cups after waiting for so long time  Also food delivery is so late You order it now you get it literally half an hour late
226,Cafe Shuffle,4,While this place is more common for hookah most of the food menu is good as well We tried the Jalapeo cheese balls Veg Lasagne chicken tikka pizza fish fingers The pizza and lasagne were good other dishes were pretty average Its a pocket friendly place with nice ambience and loud music The service is good too Overall nice place for hanging out with friends
227,Cafe Shuffle,4,Ordered in from the cafe so cant say much about the ambience the food however was good Loved the chicken lasagna which was spicy and flavourful Had also ordered fish fingers but found those only okay It lacked the fishy flavor and tasted like normal fried chicken fingers Will probably visit here soon to be able to give a better detailed review Would give it a 35 but the restaurant gets the benefit of a 4 because of the 5 point scale

249,Caf-Eleven,4,"Loved the ambience and the interior very colourful and lively
The seating is spacuous
The food tasted really good
The chicken was eavenly cooked and was soft
We ordered lemon chicken dragon chicken and jalapeno poppers
The poppers were oily but otherwise it was good
Great music
Nice sheesha
One disadvantage  the sheesha is only for one hour on the weekends  Wed like to obviously sit for more time
Otherwise everything is great
Staff can be a little more well learnt or greetable"
250,Caf-Eleven,4,Its actually a hookah cafe with awesome ambience and good food and a bit slow service  I ordered chicken burger which wasnt very good but the barbecue chicken wings were awesome Its a great place for hanging out with your friends
251,Caf-Eleven,3.5,"Visited this place on a weekday and only 2 or 3 tables were filled This place is located in the same building of sapphire toys in the main road of kamakya road

Ordered KitKat shake ide to milkshake onion rings and chilly chicken Everything was pretty decent
Chilly chicken was spicy and tasty Onion rings could have been done more well Both the milkshake was above average Sheesha is the main attraction

Ambience is decent Theyve used an old scooter and made it look attractive Service is prompt and good"
252,Caf-Eleven,4,"A hookah lounge

Bakasura makes it a point to mention such info before every review As some are particular in such ambience

Its bakasura Recommended

The food bakasura ordered were fries nachos pizza blueberry Oreo and virgin mojito

When it comes to food Every single thing was good The nachos was crazily special The blueberry Oreo milkshake is something that bakasura Recommends Pizza was thick crust and very well stuffed

Coming to the ambience Its rooftop and its crazily colourful The yellow chairs and the Christmas tree that was put up Everything is perfect
Staff needs a slight improvement
Overall its great

253,Caf-Eleven,1,For the price we pay here worst food I have tasted  steaks are bit ok but not that good I love pasta to the core but red sauce pasta had lots and lots of basil in it and taste was also not gud I wouldnt recommend this place
254,Caf-Eleven,3,"Ambience This cafe is located in banashankari 2nd stage near kamakya theatre This is basically a cafe on the rooftop which is very busy all the time The place has nostalgia feels because old scooters are present inside which attracts everyone Has small LED lights lamps dream catchers and plants around which looks cute during evening

Food  1 BBQ veg pizza was very big and was good But wasnt yummy as expected
2 Arrabiata pastaThis is a must try Was really tasty and yummy and creamy
3 Jalapeno cheese balls was very cheesy and hot hot served with mayo
4 Oreo milkshake was okay okay

Service was really bad"

257,Caf-Eleven,4,"First thing first do book a table if youre going here on a weekend We had to wait for about 20 minutes
Talking about the service I think it has to get slightly better 35
Though people prefer this place for sheesha Id been there just to grab a few snacks The cafe frappe and mushroom pepper were great No complains 455

258,Caf-Eleven,2,Before cafe eleven was good enough with the food stuffs and all but now staff has been changed and it is not a pocket friendly cafe too and service is too poor  hookahs are good enough but food taste is up to the mark  ambience is good enough 
259,Caf-Eleven,3,Its a decent rooftop with pretty funky ambience like scooters colourful seats and green pots on it Food tastes good I didnt liked brownie fraape and our order took a lot of time too just look towards that once Its pretty good place for hookah lovers Reasonable price too Overall one time visit is ok
260,San Churro Cafe,3,Ambience is not that good enough and its not a pocket friendly cafe and the quantity is not that good and desserts are too good enough 
261,San Churro Cafe,3,"Went there for a quick bite with friends
The ambience had more of corporate feel I would say it was unique
Tried nachos pasta churros and lasagne

Nachos were pathetic Seriously dont order
Pasta was okayish
Lasagne was good
Nutella churros were the best
Overall an okayish experience
Peace "
262,San Churro Cafe,4,"First of all a big thanks to the staff of this Cafe Very polite and courteous

I was there 15mins before their closing time Without any discomfort or hesitation the staff welcomed me with a warm smile and said theyre still open though they were preparing to close the cafe for the day

Quickly ordered the Thai green curry which is served with rice They got it for me within 10mins hot and freshly made

It was tasty with the taste of coconut milk Not very spicy it was mild spicy

I saw they had yummy looking dessert menu should go there to try them out

A good spacious place to hang out for coffee pastas pizza or Thai food"
263,San Churro Cafe,3,A place for people who love churos Otherwise its a normal simple cafe like any other in town  Can go and spend the evening there  The positive being it is one of the better cafes in and around Banashankari and also the place is not very crowded 
264,San Churro Cafe,3,Have been visiting this place since years The quality has gone down drastically Food quality has become very average from good Service is also very bad of late
265,San Churro Cafe,1,"Really disappointed with the place

Seems like a old dusty store room stacked up with old sofas and chairs The decor is soo disappointing that I cannot put it in words
Lastly the food was cherry on the cake to make it a complete worse meal

This place is the last option you should ever consider"

267,San Churro Cafe,1,"Cockroaches  I Repeat cockroachesBakasura was disappointed
Being in Banashankari being a gold outlet and nesting them who can even think of that Thankfully it wasnt over bakasuras plate The ambience was last cleaned a decade back i guess A cockroach just walked over our table As it was alive and well moving  the bakasura couldnt take a pic of it Then the staff had to actually take it out of our table Such ambience  like what are you upto

Bakasura disapproves I dont even want to talk about the food"

The place is famous for churros the name suggests so I would love to visit again to try all the other items out "
283,San Churro Cafe,4,"I love the desserts more than anything here Good place and well served 
We dint like the nachos here  it was not that good as we expected 
Except nachos almost all dish were quite good"
284,San Churro Cafe,2,2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined Churros was hard pizza was pathetic loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO Yes mayonnese Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other Thatll be my last visit San Churros
285,Cafe Vivacity,2,Not so good place as I was expecting from here The ambience is quite ok but the food is not good at all and very slow service There were only two people in the outlet to serve the customers not satisfied upto the mark

we were attending a meeting nearby and my partner recommended to have a cup of coffee here While Looking at the cafe from outside itself got impressed with there ambience with white picket fence  with few outdoor seating Awesome decor lovely indoor ambience with AC and comfortable cushion seating with board games in the big shelf with 100 more books to read
We settled in their swing chair seating with the view of outside and ordered for filter coffee french fries brownie with ice cream
Must try filter coffee is perfect for south Indians strong and with a good quantity
Periperi french fries were so tasty

Coming to food we ordered

Corn n Cheese Garlic Bread  55

Belgian Waffle with Icecream  45

288,Catch-up-ino,1,"This place is right opposite to the theatre and remember youll have to climb up all the way up to 4th floor as theres no lift You will be tired by the time you reach unless you are a fitness freak
Well for starters asked the man to give me his best shot of hookah so we could come back and surprisingly he gave us the worst of it Asked for a strong but got a tasteless flavoured was a mix of 3
Avoid masala french fries as they were bad it looked like he just put all the Mirchi he had in the kitchen
I wish I would have taken the pic
A cool place to hangout when your girl is getting a hair treatment in perimeter salon
Nevertheless it was okay I hope they would improve their ambience and service

289,Kirthi's Biryani,3,New place though its a biryani placeI tried Chinese food Best thing is the quantity too good for the price Food was kind of oknot great Definitely worth the price A slight improvement with the taste will make the place a favourite
290,Kirthi's Biryani,3,Had been here to enjoy ice cream but was not happy They have tried something new but did not succeed I suggest them to try something innovative as other Icecream ships do Havent tried their wood fire pizzas still But friends have suggested that pizza is tasting very good
291,T3H Cafe,4,Happy to see such a cafe nearby to our house Its not in bsk actually Its very much diagnolly opposite to nu hospital kidney foundation at Padmanabhanagar This cafe is run by a couple and their family Theyre really very polite and friendly The prices are very reasonable and I recommend this place for people who like to spend time with their friends I had coffee which is amazing I had cheese Maggie and masala fries which were well presented and prepared as well Content of the food is very sufficient and I request the management not reduce the quality and quantity of the food And not to increase the prices as well I wish them all the best and request them to maintain the taste of the food as it is
292,T3H Cafe,1,We read quite reviews of the place and hence chose to spend a Saturday evening here This is a house converted into a cafe  It is in a nascent stage  The service is very poor and the taste is not worth the wait We waited for 20 minutes for our Maggi Service needs to improve

297,The Vintage Cafe,2,This is a tiny caf located just opposite Kathriguppe Water Tank The interiors are quite nice and they serve a mix of Indian and American snacks The food isnt too good neither are the beverages Ive tried the Strawberry Milk Shake as well as Iced Tea and they have been nothing but flavored sugar syrups mixed with milkwater My pick of beverages here is the Chikmagalur Filter Coffee which is priced at 15 This caf is not really vintage but not terrible either
298,The Vintage Cafe,1,Worst place not at al worth for money dont ever visit for 140rs u get a small pizza which is totally yuk and service is also too poor waste of money and time dont visit
299,The Vintage Cafe,2,"A really tiny place and nothing vintage about it The food has hardly any quantity when it came to the veg cheese corn sandwich There were literally just 5 french fries with the paneer burger Ordered a pizza which was not good It felt like eating just cheese and no hardly any vegetables in it Not great service as well They dont have chilli flakes and oregano
K Thats all"
300,The Vintage Cafe,3,Very cuteee placesuchha kutty place but very decorative peaceful toou can pay n play ludo n all there is a book ssection n no good books so they can improve on that coffee is good but sandwich was bad cheese was no baked can improve on food
301,Woodee Pizza,3,"Decided to take a break from my usual Pizza Parlour And also coz I love the Pineapple and Jalapeos combination that many pizza parlours dont make Having found one thst makes it I decided to give it a shot

Tried their
Hot Golden Cake Pizza Pineapple Corn and Jalapeos  dont get fooled by the use of the term cake The pizza was very good  loads of cheese thin crust and served hot What I was disappointed with was the stringent use of Pineapple and corn Pineapple was cut so small thst it was smaller than the corn kernel Very disappointing indeed 

Jalapeo Garlic Bread Didnt much care for it though it was also loaded and bursting at the seams with cheese and Jalapeos
It was too doughy"

303,Cafe Coffee Day,1,Quality of coffee has gone worse So so so diluted coffee Though I ordered cold coffee it was not at all cold Even AC seemed to be off in this summer as we felt really hot through out our time Instead of paying service taxes n getting horrible coffee n sweating its better to buy coke or drink water or visit better cafes
304,Cafe Coffee Day,3,Its a nice place to hangout because ambience is very relaxing They serve different varieties of coffee And recently theyve added sandwiches burgers  But theyre not UpTo the mark The only thing I like here is toastizza Not worth the price

I would want to visit this place any day anytime alone or with anybody for that matter and it sure does gimme a good feel

My personal favourite Hot cappuccino Chilli cheese sandwich  the combo  a mango shot  for a lil cold feel 

banana chips and some nice VH1 music else the manager Mallesh is sweet enough to switch on the tv for us in case of any cricket matches being played that day

Many ppl dont like this caf maybe cause of traffic and the noise but I personally feel once you are seated insideoutside with your buddies comfortablythese things become trivial 

Try the new Veg wraps"

541,Coffee Tindi,4,"Small South Indian restaurant next to My office One should stand and eatif you love panner then definitely you should try panner in green pepper sauceit really tastes yummypanner pepper dry which they serve is equally good

Update Today Tried baby corn lollipop here and it was lip Smacking"
542,Sea Green Cafe,5,"Newly opened cafe near KIMS Medical College
Spacious and pleasant ambiance
Must try Chicken Pakoda and Crispy Fried Chicken
Sheesha happy hours offers are good and affordable"
543,Cuppa,1.5,"This place was good to hangout when it was new Now it has nothing to it more than a bunch of regulars smoking their lungs out and some noisy college students playing pool
Beware of the roaches here
Conclusion is bad coffee no ambiance too noisy and mostly nothing to eat"
544,Cuppa,3.5,"Probably this is the only cafe which hardly has customers Ive visited this particular outlet about 34 times and everytime not more than 23 tables are ever occupied
Have tried their coffee corn spinach sandwich and mango smoothie
Kappa is not very expensive as compared to its competitors
Service was good However they had burnt our sandwich But replaced it immediately without any argument"
545,Cuppa,5,Coffee Nachos Greenwave Sandwich Paneer Sandwich are some of all time favorites Basket of fries is amazing No hassle parking available Nice courteous staff
546,Cuppa,3,Not a huge fan of the ambience Esp when its sunny n the dry wind kills you at noon this is the last place on earth I wanna sit n dine  Been here a couple of times Very courteous n attentive staff though Quick service as well Love their Chicken Tikka sandwich They have a good range of quick bites as well esp the potato wedges being a favorite Plus used to like their Lasagna pretty much with all that spicy juicy meat stuffed in
547,Cuppa,3,"I never used to like this branch of Cuppa The tea they serve tastes weird Their donuts are extremely hard and etc
But after they have started off with hookah Ive started frequenting it The hookah you get here is one of the best in South Bangalore
Itd be a better place if their snack ons are paid more attention to by the chefs"
548,Cuppa,3,"Ordered cold coffee and sandwich and espresso  Sandwich was average espresso and cold coffee were good


Ambiance 355
Food quality 35
Service 355
Overall 3  5"
549,Srinathji's Cafe,5,"No words for the paneerone of the few places where u get authentic paneer dishes Hotel staff are really good and the food quality is very very good

Parking  2 wheeler and 4 wheeler available
Payment mode  Cash and card
Next time will try out pastries "
550,Redberrys,4,Redberrys will provideswonderful ice cream flavours and some tasty delights to fill up your tummy with the italian touch friendly staffs quick response towards the customer food in redberrys were good and tasty we loved the pizzas that they serve nice place to hangout with friends one of the best place to jump in
551,Redberrys,4,Its a place for having Gelato not Ice creams They have quite good variety of fresh gelatos They are known for gelatos although they have started serving Burgers Pizza Pasta now Pastries  cakes But I prefer this place for gelato they are made fresh very tasty and prices are nominal The location of the cafe is on the busy DVG Road some of the gelato flavors which I liked are Bramhins coffee Belgian Chocolate Oreo Blast French Vanilla and Bubble gum The pricing of their geltos are priced very economically and offer value for money I didnt try other offerings so I wont be able to comment on the same  They also take orders for cakes and pastries The place is neatly maintained hygienic has seating arrangements for 1520 people Decent ambience  One can visit this place and enjoy their Italian Gelatos
552,Redberrys,5,"1 pizza shake and salad very nice
2 location of red Barrys very nice
3 staff good
4 over all redberrys very nice places cool  simple places to enjoy evening with group of friends nice"
553,Redberrys,5,"I stopped by this place when I saw the board on its door saying they have a buy one get one free offer When I went in the place seemed ok not a big cafe just a small shop with some seating arrangement and airconditioning
Food I ordered a paneer and bell pepper pizza Joes burger a Alfredo penne pasta and a farmhouse pizza EVERY SINGLE DISH WAS AMAZING They were fully fresh extremely authentic taste and super budget friendly I also ordered a chocolate cake with Snickers ice cream That was brilliant too
Im Definitely come here again If you guys are on a tight budget and want to eat amazing food do come here"
554,Foodiction,1,"Worst restaurant ever  Veg Manchurian worth 130 doesnt even fill a tiny cup size DO NOT order food fro this place is a rip off with no regard for the money they charge
Worst restaurant even for zomato"
555,Foodiction,1,Im very sorry to say that you people lack in hygiene I can upload the photo of biryani rice which I ordered just now having a small cockroach in itit was really disgusting and Ill surely not order anything or recommend anything from your restaurant but please maintain hygiene for the customer who comes to you I wont say anything about taste as the portion what I ate was good but I became completely disappointed when I saw a dead baby cockroach

1139,Faasos,4,"Faasos is kind of food saver for many bachelors They have a huge food list serving in different styles And even festival foods Recently during dasara have ordered food which was very filling and tasty

sandeepkasalwordpresscom"
1140,Faasos,4,"Faasos is one of my favorite food joint And they are excellent in delivering their things on time They have a vast menu to dig in and almost all the dishes they serve is made to please your taste buds
Now lets talk about the Wraps that I had so the first wrap that I had was
Jumbo Chicken Wrap it tasted really good it was pretty balanced in flavor and thay also provide with their signature spice to add a hot kick to your dish

The Second wrap that I had was Cheese Melt Chicken Wrap this is a new wrap in their menu for all the cheese lovers out their but according to me the amount of cheese that they put in should be made less because more of cheese makes the dish very salty and it does suppress the flavors of the toppings

Overall my experience was good and you guys should order your favorite dishes as the prices are really nominal"
1141,Faasos,5,This has been my goto place ever since my office days Delicious foods at affordable prices the key to this place that it has every ingredient for your whole day meal Starting from breakfast bread to lunch bowls to evening snacks and late night biriyani I have ordered my favorite kulchas with some spicy chhole and the delectable chicken tikka wrap The wrap was so filled with chickens that will mouth will bless you for the same Parantha with mutton keema was brilliant The sheared pieces of mutton with tender and warm parathas are just the need of the hour for me

We ordered
1 Chicken keema tikki wrap  Amazing
2 Jumbo chicken rice feast  Amazing"
1255,Faasos,3,"I had ordered cheese and paneer wraps  the wraps were good with just right amount of spice and masala  the paneer content was also good which I got wholesome of paneer and cheese Though the price is on higher side  the wraps kind off justified the price I would recommend the wraps I think 1 or 2 wraps would fill your tummy on an average  give it a try if you like some good wraps

The singhada aloo paratha with paneer makanwala is not that great and the gravy provided was very bland and you try to order other good stuff from them"
1256,Behrouz Biryani,1,"Had ordered Zaikedaar paneer biryani regular for lunch

Considering the history explained on the package box about the behrouz biryani legacy of 2000 years i clearly felt it was not upto the mark as i have been a biryani lover for years now Given the price i had to pay for this food 324 rupees for ONE biryani they could have done much better than what i got The biryani was dry Medium flavoured The rice was not frangrant

I was asked to choose one among  Mint chutney or gravy I needed to pay more if i wanted both  Even a place that would give 80 rupee biryani provides both of this accomplaints

The packaging was good but only half of the box was biryani Other half was chutney and jamoon Felt disppointed with less qty

Only thing i can appreciate is the gulab jamoon

Value for money  15 1 is given for gulab jamoon
Packaging  45
Quantity  35
Quality  35"
1257,Behrouz Biryani,5,Behrouz Biryani is one of the best Biryanis I have ever had The oil used is fortune Biryani special oil Which really makes up the taste The rice quality is very good Taste of Biryani is delicious The mutton pieces are so big and tender I will definitely order again Its reasonable and its all in one pack
1258,Behrouz Biryani,5,Incredibly rich i am so bissed towards them that I have made Behrouz my goto Biryani everytime I think about the B word This time had bhuna murgh biryani which came on a platter of fragrant rice with dry fruits sprinkled on top Majestic Id say Got some crisp shallow fried chicken sausages along with the biryani such a refreshing change Way to go Behrouz As I said you are the new B word in town
1259,Behrouz Biryani,5,so epic biryanis just loved it ordered the shahi biryani with shahi kebabs the packing was so good just amazing and tasty also mouth watering biryani with the mint sauce loved it
1260,Behrouz Biryani,5,Heard alot about Behrouz Biryani Its a recipe from 2000 years The rice used is basmati which gives richness in the Biryani Food is really good I liked the fact its a meal box you get curd and Gulabjamun along with that I had a great lunch and it was sufficient for 1 person Their were tender soft pieces of Mutton and the taste was really good
1261,Behrouz Biryani,5,"We had our mouth watering biryaani from behrouz Biryani Their packing was really amazing and the biryani appeared to be very tempting It had the best biryani i had ever tasted It was full of masala The rice was very soft and so was the chicken The masala when mixed with the rice

Tasted like heaven It gave a maximum level of satisfaction Any biryani lover would crave for this chicken biryani Along with it we had the gulab jamun which was soft and fresh The sugar water was all inside the gulab jamun"
1262,Behrouz Biryani,5,Its one of the best place for real biryani lovers Its my regular place when I am in Delhi and always the 1st choice when am on trip to any place Came to Bengaluru for an official trip and was carving for biryani and saw the outlet of Behrouza trusted placeordered murgh Kefta and chicken Biryanibiryani came with raita and a yummy gulab jamun Just finished the food within few minutes Always one of my 1st choice whenever possible
1263,Behrouz Biryani,4,This review is based on an online order I ordered a paneer biryani through the behrouz app faasos The delivery took around 45 minutes Packaging was good but there was no cutlery given to me Biryani was fantastic and fresh Ample quantity for 1 person and good masala was added along with few almond chunks They also give raita and jamoon with the biryani This was for 240 and I feel the price can be more competitive
1264,Behrouz Biryani,5,Ordered a murg makhani biryani  king size  Loved the presentation of the dish with shavings of almonds Perfectly cooked and flavoured long grain rice The masala was yummy This dish made my day My family loved this biryani too
1265,Fast And Fresh,1,Half baked rice in a special meal Half baked roti only panneer curry was good Serve the order with good quality or stop serving food in late nights or mid night

Save money for the morning and have something worth spending rather than having food from here

Food quantity is good for the price
You must try the leefu chicken and chilli garlic noodlesThe chicken lollipop is also good
Small place but service and home delivery through zomato is good"
1445,Szechuan Dragon,4,"We got home delivery from here on a Sunday night Its good Chinese food and not very heavy on the pocket as well The chicken soup was good so was the chicken wings
Liked it "
1446,Szechuan Dragon,4,Its a good option for affordable indo Chinese cuisine in the neighborhood of Banashankari Food seems a little spicy and oily Will definitely satisfy your cravinga for some Chinese food
1447,Szechuan Dragon,5,The staff in Szechuan Dragon is extremely friendly and well trained The ambience is great A must visit place with friends and family The food is served in a reasonable amount of time and is great
1448,Szechuan Dragon,1,One more place with wrong over rating stars Not worth saying anything the food was so bad and didnt tastes anything it was like just some stuff which you can eat Surprisingly the dish was their chefs special Lol seriously how do these people get their food licenses
1449,Szechuan Dragon,5,Well what can I say about this place its one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever been to We reached here during the closing hours of lunch First we had the Manchow soup which blew my mind It was followed by the shredded chicken which was also mesmerising They we had the mixed Fu Yong which didnt live up to my expectations Then we headed on to the main course of Singapore noodles accompanied by roast chilli chicken Everything was unbelievably good Definitely going back
1450,Szechuan Dragon,4,"Dont go by the looks and location of the place you may be suprised by the no of parcels going out and people at the place The food will definitely fulfill your ravenous chinese appetite The whole menu has a lot of wonderful food try the lollipop hunan prawns or chicken Dimsum chicken
Staff is polite and service is fast The handwash facility is something to improve Enjoy"
1451,Szechuan Dragon,4,This is just a jump from my houseToday bought manchow soup and spring roll it was niceNoodles was good It was packed well Next time will have at the resturant itself for better taste
1452,Szechuan Dragon,3,To be honest I have had better Chinese than this its not a bad restaurant its just mediocre its not the best or something getting excited over We ordered some Pepper lemon coriander soup i expected it to be little tangy and spicy as the name suggests but it was not that great Leafu planner and Dragon mushrooms were not bad as well Dragon chicken seems to be good We ordered pulpy orange for a drink it was okay Prices are reasonable and quantity is okay As I said earlier its not a bad restaurant but its not something I would Id die for
1453,Szechuan Dragon,4,"Heard that this place is listed in top 100 must visit places in banglore
So decided to visit it and it did not disappoint us
The place was small with around 1215 tables
We have ordered
Veg wonton soup  455
Leefy baby corn 55
Dragon chicken  455
Butter garlic rice  45
Pulpy grape juice  35
Dragons liar  45
Dragons liar is an ice cream and it presented along with fried noodles
Kind of weird combination but tasted good"
1454,Szechuan Dragon,4,"This a simple laid back restaurant with minimal ambience pretty famous among college students as the prices are reasonable Its also one of those place where people visit only with word of mouth as it doesnt have eyepopping sign boards or anything

Have been here quite a few times the food is good and its not very greasy like most Chinese places

Got general Tsos mushrooms Kung pao babycorn and honey chilli potatoes all were good

Main course was leefu fried rice schezwan fried rice and veg ball manchurian sauce all were sumptuous

So if u r looking for a quick fix dinner and nothing very fancy this is the place"

Packaging  food quality was good"

1458,Empire Restaurant,3,"As a vegetarian this would be our last option However when the rest of Bangalore is closed this place always takes care of hunger
After party late night we ended up here for a quick meal Its crowded as usual but you get a table for sure
We ordered Egg dosa Ghee rice Dal and Arabian grape juice
Egg dosa was really confusing and I didnt get it However Ghee rice and Dal is always good here
Arabian Grape juice is just great
Service is really quick
If not for fine dining for a quick meal at odd hours when you dont have options this is a place to be"
1459,Empire Restaurant,4,Very nice experience Roomali roti is really good only thing is chicken was not cooked properly in the butter chicken curry Worth the money

When in Bangalore going to Empire becomes a default visit Again this restaurant too has many chains and so its easy to visit anyone of them

Shawarma is my all time favorite at this place Also they are many varieties of non veg and veg foodstuffs but people often visit this place for seafood and Muglai cuisines

1540,Empire Restaurant,5,Loved chicken wings severed today Great place to hangout for all non vegetarians
1541,Maruthi Davangere Benne Dosa,5,"This restaurant serves the best benne dosas period I first tried out the benne masala dosa and was stumped by the inherent taste of the dosa that I didnt require any chutney along with it Benne kaali is another must try out Its extremely crispy and light

Even the tea of this restaurant had a very unique taste that I forced myself to limit to a cup 

Highly recommend this restaurant"
1542,Chaatimes,4,Ordered pack of dabeli for rs49 today The packing was neat The size of dabeli was to the mark Taste was just yum Over all value for money

Chocolate lava cake is not that great I give a 3star"
1548,Domino's Pizza,5,"Everyone knows Dominos the pizzas are great the garlic bread is simply AMAZING love the chocolate lava cake
This time I had a cheese burst pizza It was super delicious A must have"
1549,Domino's Pizza,3,"Food  810

Like any other dominos they have the same type of sitting arrangements but here the staff is more cooperative and active They always try keep their place clean and hygienic"
1550,Domino's Pizza,4,"Really small and clumsy place its in the first floor and you wouldnt spot it instantaneously
service and food is the same as other standard dominos outlet"
1551,Domino's Pizza,4,These guys do better taste than any other dominos outlet Place and ambience also is good My request to all dominos outlets is to keep a lot of plants in and out of their outlets in order to have a better environment
1552,Onesta,5,"I personally really liked this place  The ambience with the rooftop  plants  the music is great 
The starters are good and so were the pizzas
The prices are pretty affordable Must visit place "
1553,Onesta,5,Very good pizza took unlimited pizza and could eat 3 pizzas easily per person even service is very good staff is very courteous and polite
1554,Onesta,4,Onward has been a favourite place for a Pizza for quite some time Their Happy Hour Pizzas and Pizza Combos are to be relished The pizzas are fluffy and have just the right amount of sauce and toppings to cheer you up
1555,Onesta,3,"Onesta serves unlimited pizza and desserts with pasta also
This places has multiple branches in the city and usually crowded on weekends
Service its good and decent
Prices  affordable
Food desserts and shakes are very good
But the pizzas are too thick base ones so until you order something very cheesy or with a generous topping cant taste it
The choclate banana pizza was a disappointment as was very raw"
1556,Onesta,4,I like going back to this place I really like the ambience and the fact that it is a rooftop makes it a cool place to hangout Although I keep ordering almost the same thing every time it has always turned out to be a nice experience This place is famous for its pizza but I kinda like their pasta more Also the tiramisu shots are to die for and so is the mozzarella cheese balls with a really generous amount of cheese inside I would surely recommend this place and I would definitely keep going back
1557,Onesta,5,"Bakasuras Paradise

The only place that can keep the bakasuras belly happy
My 6th visit and my 5th different onesta visit
From RR nagar JP Nagar Basavanagudi Koramangala bakasura ended up at an onesta in Banashankari as well
Every visit  its the unlimited meal that I have had But but but there is a change thats happening From unlimited pizza unlimited dessert and a beverage mocktails and everything to unlimited pizza one dessert and one aerated beverage cokePepsifanta  I have been through all And yet it never disappoints
The pizzas here are just fab and you can hardly eat like 45 pizzas in one sitting bakasura can can you Yes you can
Coming to the staff they are great
Coming to the quality its great

To finish
Be like onesta

Onesta Love"
1558,Onesta,4,It is like any other onesta outlet But I find this outlet more crowded than any other outlet that I have visited so far Food wise its the same no much of difference But since the place a little huge service is delayed usually
1559,Onesta,5,At times of a cafe bubble in Bangalore Onesta truly stands out as one the best restaurants with great food pocket friendly menu and excellent staff The place often has offers providing unlimited pizzas at prices as low as Rs 150 I have been here multiple times  tasted most of the items on menu and not once have I returned unsatisfied
1560,Onesta,5,"This is one of the biggest Onesta outlets Ive visited In the last couple of years Onesta has made a name for itself We did not have pizza places that have a buffet option

Like any other Onesta the taste is right up there and the quick service I like the thin crust pizzas here Id recommend you to take the buffet ordering a la carte is not pocket friendly"
1561,Onesta,5,"This roof top outlet of Onest  is one of the amazing places to have the best pizzas in and around Banashankari

Not only the ambience but also the cheerful yet humble service staff catalised my great experience there

1731,Hotboxit,5,Saw this restaurant on Facebook and decided to give it a try when it was close to midnight Ordered Oreo Shake and Pasta They delivered bang on time and food was absolutely mouth watering especially the Oreo shake Do give this place a try for home deliveriesaccording to their website they deliver until 3AM
1732,Kitchen Garden,3,"We ordered two Indian veg thali from Zomato as my first order got a good discount also
They sent four chapatis each rice dal paneer veggie and papad
Packaging is poor as in plastic bags still
Taste is ok ok
Paneer was too oily to eat
Dal and rice were decent in taste
Once ordering is fine for a home food experience"
1733,Kitchen Garden,3,"I ordered lemon chicken gravy onlinethe quantity was good but they had put more number of lemon pieces that the entire gravy turned out bitter in tasteI was in a dilemma reading all other reviews but thought to take a chance after all

The gravy had right amount of spices it was flavoursomebut tastewise I was not soo happyit also had a layer of oil floating at the topI hope they reduce the usage of oil in other dishes too"
1734,Recipe,3,Ordered Paneer meal via zomato app from this restaurant Its above average and thats about it Nothing to rave about this place In this meal u will get paneer gravy Plain dal White rice 3 phulkas curd pickle onions and 1 pakoda To begin with I will say the phulkas were soft and nice It goes well with both the gravies Dal was watery though Rice also goes well with both the gravys but it tastes better with Paneer gravy Paneer pieces were not soft It was a little hard Curd tasted nice Instead of pakoda they cud have given some small dessert like jamun or kheer etc Nevertheless it was average fare for the night Dont have complaints though Like I said earlier this will surely satiate your hunger but dont expect anything out of the world
1735,Beijing Bites,3,Ive ordered food from here a couple of times Must say their price is a pretty good deal especially the combos My first order was Chicken Beijing Noodles  Chicken Manchurian Gravy combo and my second ordered was Chicken noodlesChilli Chicken Gravy  Chicken Schezwan combo I love their noodles and the Chicken Schezwan tasted fab But I think the gravy can be a bit better Their packaging is neat and their price is pretty reasonable
1736,Beijing Bites,2,Ambience is the worst hereThe food here is very tasty the Perkins chicken is spicy and nicewe got the koi Thai noodles but that wasnt as good As the noodles were very thick
1737,Beijing Bites,3,"Ambiance pretty average
Food not that great with many flavours and ingredients missing
Staffs could be well more trained
Food ordered chicken manchurian and chicken hakka noodles

Overall I would just say is its a very average place with not much to look into Foods are not so good with too much of oil used Hope to expect that their fooding quality changes"
1738,Beijing Bites,3,The food offered to us wasnt great the quantity offered was less and the quality wasnt amazing the pricing on the other hand is good and you have a lot to choose from
1739,Beijing Bites,4,Small restaurant been there a couple of times Food is really good Feels like authentic Chinese Tried ordering Shanghai fried rice combohappy with the taste and quantity for the price
1740,Beijing Bites,4,I ordered Thai Chicken Red Curry with Steamed Rice online from zomatoThe taste of the food was greatThe curry taste was great being butterishDelivery time was less and the food arrived hot and freshOn the whole a less expensive great experienceGo for it
1741,Tasty Bytes,3,not a very nice place to expect hygenic and quality food especially chinese and manchurian At a very good place Quality and Quantity can be improved a lot
1742,Petoo,2,"This is a neatly made little place with entertaining wall posts that promise to deliver some good food Well I was grossly mistaken All they sell are some oddly named dishes that can hurt your taste buds and tummy really bad

This place runs on their masaledaar chole The bright red colored dish is certainly an eyesore plus can leave you sick with acidity

Overall definitely not a place worth visiting again A total disappointment both on the money part and satisfaction part  "
1743,Shree Cool Point,5,"Who would say no to such healthy and tasty breakfast delivered to Ur home
Had ordered
Musk melon juice
Carrot juice
Mushroom sandwich
Sandwich was the show stealer Perfectly spiced and grilled with generous amount of mushroom I completely loved it and will order again soon"

Firstly corn sandwich was filled with corn cheese n green chutney and perfectly toasted but it was little on the spicier side I am not really a big fan of masala puri But this was really yumm but felt quantity was less Home delivery was quick and i also feel the prices wer affordable and totally worth the money"
1745,Corner House Ice Cream,3,Always a fan of corner house Hadnt been to one in the longest time Probably that is why it all felt different It was all melty even before we started eating It just did not feel like the classic corner house this time Will definitely visit again though
1746,Corner House Ice Cream,5,As always corner house is known for its same taste and quality throughout Bangalore This outlet didnt disappoint as well Dbc and Hcf are the best here and love the chocolate sauce here
1747,Corner House Ice Cream,4,Corner house is a best place for ice cream and DBC is the beat here price is little expensive but the quantity and the quality is excellent
1748,Corner House Ice Cream,4,One of my favourite place and DBC i love the most  Must try  Place is quite good n its quite pocket friendly too for the quantity they give  Must visit  Thumbs up
1749,Corner House Ice Cream,5,I definitely prefer this place anytime and anywhere Known for its taste And varieties of ice cream this is my 1 choice to hangout Death by chocolate is a must have at this place and chocolate mousse with cream and ice cream is one of my favourites The place might be quite small and crowded post evening but the service is accurate They are hygienic and a pretty decent ambience for sure
1750,Corner House Ice Cream,5,"All though there are many ice cream parlours in Bangalore This is my favourite in the list  I have been here many times I have never returned back disappointed  Yes literally love all flavours here DBC again tops the list One should definitely have DBC here More then everything the quantity is good and so as the price I can say its the best in city with more 16 outlets all over Bangalore
Today we tired choco nutty and choco almond sundae with DBC"
1751,Corner House Ice Cream,5,"This is definitely my happy place because it makes my soul dance Being one of the well known dessert places corn house is favorite for each and every dessert lover How can someone not have death by chocolate from corner House Its one of the most satisfying things ever
Starting from DBCCake fudge cashew fudge to caramel to fruit salad with ice cream corner House have it all

1753,Biryanis And More,5,"Dear Biryanis and more
I cannot express how happy I am to have eaten the food you serve I have never been there but Ive ordered quite a few times and every single time youve amazed me Please express my gratitude to the chef
Ever since I came BangaloreI couldnt find aa single food joints that had good chicken biryani 65 and soups until I ordered from you Each of the dish Ive eaten is outstanding

Thanks a lot for making my day everytime I order Youve made a fan And a regular customer Please keep up the good work and keep the chef Heshe has the magic

Ill soon visit your restaurant"
1754,Biryanis And More,4,They have variety of biryani We have tried Boneless chicken Biryani and Egg Biryani Boneless biryani is good We have also tried Chiken noodles  which was nothing great
1755,Biryanis And More,4,"Absolutely amazing biryanis available here we tried the Afghani chicken biryani and it was delicious

The pricing is on the higher side for the service and ambience offered

Service needs to improve as we had to wait for a very long time to get the bill and food"
1756,Biryanis And More,2,"Ordered from Biryanis and more recently and really liked their concept of different types of biryani They even have 2 stores in Bangalore and has a extensive menu beyond Biryanis 

We ordered the Paneer Tikka Biryani and the Green Chilli Biryani The Paneer Tikka has large chunks of Paneer Tikka inside the biryani and the taste was good The issue with their biryani is that it has a bland taste beyond a certain point and tasted as if too much water was added before sending it over The flavor profile was not as expected The Green Chilli Biryani was green in color because of coriander paste and wasnt spicy as one would expect This biryani also had the same problem Out of the two would still prefer the Paneer Tikka Biryani

I had their Paneer Tikka Biryani and it was delicious Its one of the best Biryanis Ive had till date Definitely a top recommend for a biryani place in Bangalore "
1758,Biryanis And More,5,Ordered for the first time today chicken biryani the best I could had since quit some time in BangaloreI am thoughtful on how I never happened to know about this biryani beforeTase was very good Right amount of boneless chicken piecesless oilyright amount of masala Perfectly made
1759,Biryanis And More,1,First time Im giving one Star for this restaurant if you want to have one of the badest biryani please visit this place  me n my friend went for lunch with lot of expectation we ordered chicken biryani and egg biryani  taste was very bad and quantity is less nothing good here ambience is ok ok and service was good
1760,Biryanis And More,5,Food was good it was very tasty had fir two times and nice dum biryani really taste was awesome feeling to eat every day I will start ordering
1761,Biryanis And More,5,"We visited this place recently for a group lunch from Office
The restaurant is located on a main road and easily accessible

We were a group of 10 people and the hotel staff were kind enough to accommodate us by joining 2 tables

Coming to the Menu they have a lot of varieties of Biryanis in both Veg and NonVeg

We ordered Kaju biryani Veg Mix and Panner tikka biryani
All of them were very very tasty

Totally worth a visit to this place"
1762,Biryanis And More,4,"After reading all the reviews I thought to give it a tryordered chicken tikka chicken dum biriyani and chettinad chicken onlinedelivery was pretty quick

Coming to the food chicken tikka was perfectly cooked it just melted in my mouthmint chutney was just perfect to go along with the tikkaa 

biryani had the aroma with right amount of spices 

chettinad chicken was spicy yet tasty 

they didnt provide raitha with the biriyani"
1763,Biryanis And More,5,Biryani was exactly prepared and it was really very very hot and DUM DUM  Biryani rice was really tasteful Oil was too less I expect still more taste from u r side 
1764,Roving Feast,5,Momooooooooooo One of the best tasted ever This place is very famous that people from far distance come here Theres also spread of pastas But I choose momo over anything here Theyve the seperate counter for takeaways more like a street style and seating available too To highlight very less usage if plastic in the packages Overall Laaaavd it
1765,Roving Feast,4,We ordered Chilli noodles and Egg Fried rice from Roving feast Banashankri Noodles were really yummy and spicy they were well cooked and fresh The Egg Fried rice was a little bland Overall hygience wise good place
1766,Roving Feast,3,Home delivery order  just to have some starters Found that they have a wide range of starters got the crispy chilli chicken and veg momos in manchurian sauce Momos were a let down had just cabbage and onion hence not much of a taste Quantity is good but the taste isnt Chilli chicken was good
1767,Roving Feast,3,"Had been here for a quick bite We tried steamed Momos and paneer Momos in schezwan sauce While the plain Momos were nice and definitely above average the Momos in schezwan sauce tasted different Having a sticky consistency it tasted sweet but also spicy at the same time

Overall I would rate this place 35 but the service here was very slow Hence the 05 reduction"
1768,Roving Feast,4,While its a good place for pastas the service here can be very slow We went as a group of 8 and they had wrongly done a couple of dishes Taste was fine but quantity is kind of less which is understandable because prices are low Its a small place so be prepared to wait for sometime
1769,Roving Feast,4,"I am a regular goer of this place from many years and love this place for their Chinese and Italian cuisines which will be served for the lesser price  Love those white sauce pastas and arrabiata pastas which gives some desi feel as well as with those Italian flavoursnoodles  fried rice and some main course for the accompaniment is my favorite over heremust try place in Bangalore you will have lot of choices for the mealyou even get soup and can call it a 3 course or 5 course meal

1774,Roving Feast,3,Had heard quite a lot about this place located opposite to the Banashankari BDA This place is mainly famous for snacks and quick bites Pasta sauce is highly diluted and lacks cheese and taste Noodles are pretty good I feel that the price doesnt do justice to the quantity they serve Fries are really good too The place is great for quick snack if you dont want to spend a lot But otherwise you can try meals at the other places in BDA for great taste and value for money
1775,Roving Feast,4.5,"What fast food

Ambience compact but neat and clean

This place is very compact but serves some good food tat can tickle ur taste buds I visit this place to just have momo Manchurian My frnd told me abt this momo Manchurian tat was served by this place N I had never tried it Just to try this visited this place Must say it was best momo manchurian I just loved it Also tried Russian salad and pasta which was also very good One must visit this place in the evenings during winter season and its gonna be awesome experience

I will definitely visit this place again"
1776,FreshMenu,5,"What continental food

Online delivery food chain

Last time when the food was delivered in a bad condition had second thoughts for ordering again from this place Being skeptical ordered chicken noodles but to my surprise the food was yummy This time they delivered Wat was ordered

Thanks for the prompt delivery and did really enjoyed the food"
1777,FreshMenu,3,"Long pending review I have been wanting to review but some how got postponed I had ordered food few weeks back as I was alone I ordered spinach potpie and lucknowie panner biryani
I liked the potpie but biryani taste was average May be I should few more of their items"
1778,FreshMenu,3,"2 star is the rating for the quantity of food I would give a 4 star rating for quality Averaging is the final score

I was severely disappointed at the quantity of Ceaser salad Brands like eatfit would give double the quantity for the same price I mean come on atlest a decent amount of lettuce so that you fill your hunger I ordered the pot pie in a seperate order after the salad just cause the salad was not enough The cheese potpie was lacking salt and taste I get that this is healthy food but doesnt mean we need to skip on basic condiments

Not very keen on ordering again from fresh menu unless there is no other option"
1779,FreshMenu,5,Down right the best comfort food of all times The menu consists of such light and soothing food that doesnt make you feel stubby Also this gulab jamum mango jar is to die for
1780,FreshMenu,3,Ordered a southwestern fried chicken creamy pepper fusilli and cookie dough cake Fried chicken didnt seem like the one on the picture The chicken was cooked well but flavour was lacking Fusilli pasta as well lacked the herbs Cookie dough cake was yummy though
1781,FreshMenu,4,Time for healthy and yummy foodget it ordered from your nearest freshmenu outletNow I forgot the names of the dish but as you see one of them is Arabian pasta which was cold by the time it got delivered yet tasty and the best thing was this paneer salad filled with loads of veggies definitely filled me over but main courses are still the best if you ask me
1782,Banashankari Donne Biriyani,3,Pretty much hyped place u can say taste and quality as usual like other donne biryani nothing so unique or usp as such kabab was very bad and so were the mutton items couldve been faaaar better
1783,Wamama,4,"I really like the decor and ambience wamama exudes The sushi is surprisingly good but I was disappointed that they had run out of wasabi when they served it Id recommend checking with the staff before you order as I cant do sushi without wasabi
The char Sui bao was a tad too sweet for me The portion sizes of their appetisers were quite large for two of us so we just had a egg fried rice for main course which tasted great but had us picking out too many pieces of ginger and bamboo shoot constantly
For dessert we had the peanut butter chocolate mousse which wasnt bad
Service could improve but Im just happy that they have sushihearts"
1784,Wamama,5,"Wamama  this is the 7th visit of mine to this place its in BSK 2nd stage opp to the BDA complex a roof top Chinese restaurant which is pocket friendly

I generally prefer the soups and dimsums here they are perfectly cooked and tasty"
1785,Wamama,3,"Wamama an Asian cuisine restaurant which has pretty colorful ambience easily located and you would get different varieties of asian food 
So I went here with my best friend and my experience was kinda okayish 
We ordered Fruit punch Korean wings Hongkong noodles Thai steamed fish and Kapa Maki Sushi 
Wings and sushi tasted amazing noodles could have been better fish was average 
Service could be done a little faster Overall its a decent place to visit and you would have a good time"
1786,Wamama,3,All the items that I have tried here  the only thing that I love is their sushi   other things were very oily Hope they could reduce the oil in the food
1787,Wamama,4,"Great ambience  good service and good food

Been there on a weekday evening for a casual dinner

They serve wine  no other alcohols served

The starters were okaythe baby corn manchurian was avg

The tried the khow suey was good slightly more coconut milk than I prefer but the overall taste was good They serve it both mains and soup I had the one with noddles for the main course

Service was good and fast

Worth a visit"
1788,Wamama,3,"Had gone to this restaurant after reading some good reviews about it Dont know why so much of hype created

The food was a insipid here Had ordered for a chicken Wonton soup which was bland and the was a Lil sticky
Among starters had ordered whole pepper chicken it was very salty and after complaining about it it was altered just by adding some more spices and it tasted even worse

Had ordered fiery chilly chicken outside it was coated with green chilly paste and not cooked well And at last we had ordered for a veg hongkong noodles which tasted good

But definitely would appreciate their ambience service and hygiene and can be given 3 ratings for the same They have paly area for kids as well so that parents can have some leisure time 

Lastly they dont have parking space need to park to opp Bda complex area And the exorbitant price is not worthy I felt"
1789,Wamama,5,Its located on the third floor between McDonalds and Vinnys This place has really good Asian food Tried their vegetarian sushi and it was pretty good Also had their steamed rice and Thai curry which were good The service was very nice  our order took a reasonable amount of time and they were helpful in suggesting what to order The ambience is nice and theres a lot of space Would like to visit again
1790,Wamama,4,"Cant say this enough but we do need more places like these in South Bangalore  Wamama is an understated nicely done restaurant offering Asian cuisine We ended up going here on a rainy evening 

My experience They have few select items for each cuisine be it Japanese Chinese Malaysian Thai etc We had the Chinese Bao as a starter Very warm soft and the flavours were bang on We had the grill plate as our main course with the Chicken in chilli garlic and Singaporean noodles and Basa in yellow curry Both amazing to taste and the quantity for each was more than enough for two people 

The service was very good with amicable servers They even proactively got a baby booster seat for us which was clean  a rarity in restaurants and of good quality 

A definite go to place for Asian food in Banashankari"
1791,Wamama,3,"The decor and service is top notch We visited on a Saturday afternoon wasnt too crowded They serve Pan Asian Cuisine We tried the Paneer Chilli and assorted veg dim sum platter for the vegetarians The Bok Choy aNd Tofu dim sum was a miss Had a very odd after taste It could be the tofu but something wasnt right

Japanese Fried Chicken Karaage  Was good Wasnt authentic but tasted nice Crispy outside and soft in the Center

We also ordered Prawn Char kway Teow since they were out of Pad Thai The prawn could have been fresh

They only have Wine and Wine based cocktails

Overall it was a hit and a miss"
1792,Wamama,4,"We were craving for good Chinese food this place came to our mind and decided to drop in based on some trustworthy reviews A roof top cafe kind of ambiance with lush green decor
We went around 3pm and ordered Mushroom Manchurian Manchow Soup Bol Choy  Tofu Dumpling and Wamama Special Bao To be precise they got authentic Pan Asian and Indo Chinese dishes as well We loved all the dishes except Bok Choy  Tofu Dumpling seems like it was steamed more than the actual time Probably its an instance The prices are not expensive and service was quick I would certainly go and try main course sometime

1793,Wamama,3,Tried this place based on Zomato rating  was pleasantly surprised The people were receptive  responded fast  Tried the sushi  the dimsum The taste quotient was 35  with the dim sum being bit on the saltier side Seems like a honest place  they did not charge the service tax on the bill  unlike many other restaurants  Overall for the price they charge  it is a value for money 
1794,Wamama,4,"Thinking of Asian food i came across this place which is on the 4th floor Though its not that visible we could figure that out
Ambience They have a beautiful Ambience and nice decore
Food Food is good We had nothing to complain We had veg corn spinach dumpling which was fantastic and was served with red chilli pastesauce The yesai tempura was more kind of friend and which is definitely not s main course to order  its more kinda starter which is deep friend veggies
Finally the the Veg meal bowl which was served with noodle and coconut based sauce which was good but had s lot of coconut milk flavour
Overall its a good restaurant and will definitely visit again"

The food here is the best thing you will eat
Dim sum is heavenly try the one with chicken You will even get the juice of the cooked food in your mouth and its completely worth it
Spring rolls are just too amazing the chutney they serve it with is something u would have never tasted elsewhere you should definitely try it
the noodles here are pretty much like anywhere else Even though u wouldnt have had much starter this will fill you up

1903,Wamama,5,Cant find one thing wrong here Everything from food taste qualityambience is great At this price it makes it even better Definitely a must visit
1904,Wamama,4,Pleasant ambience and amazingly friendly staff Being vegetarians we were pleasantly surprised at the variety offered for vegetarians We got the dimsum platter of which we like only the spinach and corn dimsum We ordered veg satay but the masala on it was a bit too much and did not do justice to an Asian cuisine We ordered Japanese noodles which was a good change from the regular Asian places This place will surely be a hit in no time 1 star for the awesome staff
1905,Wamama,4,"Ambience service food good Price and quantity not so much but still acceptable I guess Cheese cherry pineapple was a rip offCome on guys atleast include 8 sticks The Thupka was awesome Wamama special wine cocktail was also good

Overall a good place if you want to try fusion food of different cuisine May visit again on a rainy day for a hot bowl of ramen"
1906,Wamama,5,"Nice ambience Good food Perfect location for me as I was waiting for some good dining options near BDA complex Staff is friendly They have buy 2 get 1 free house wine options which is good As this was out first visit we had veg Satay Schezwan noodles Usually I order a gravy along with my ricenoodles But this was good to eat as it is
Will definitely go back for more"
1907,Wamama,2,I ordered food from this place and was very disappointed Being a big fan of Japanese food I ordered teriyaki chicken and Japanese chicken fried rice The teriyaki chicken had more mushrooms and onions than chicken and was nothing close to the authentic dish The fried rice was made of normal rice not the Japanese sticky jasmine rice And there wasnt one tiny trace of chicken in the chicken fried rice Though the taste of both dishes were decent they were nothing like Their names
1908,Five Star Chicken,1,Third class fraudulent gives me regular popcorn n says thats medium n charges 110 for it n when I all for a bill he enters it as spicy chicken roll 552110
1909,Five Star Chicken,4,The rolls and burgers are very goodthey take a very long time but its worth the wait I love the popcorn of 5 star they are very yummmyyyy 
1910,Five Star Chicken,3.5,"This place is obviously meant only for take aways SoJudging them like the other reviewers on the basis of Ambience would be wrong
The Staff is Very friendly  The Food is good too avoid the rolls  Burger  Youll be good to go
Chicken pieces Popcorn  Italian hotdog are worth every penny  If you get lucky You might get fresh Food Right out of the kitchen"
1911,Five Star Chicken,3,Wings are pretty good Puri puri chicken fry was good as well No place to sit Takes a long time to get you what you ordered Does not accept cards which totally sucks
1912,Five Star Chicken,3,Its a concept almost like KFC only this place doesnt have any place to sit So you have to parcel mostly Chicken roll is good Burger is OK not great Safe bet is Chicken items They are tasty and cheaper than KFC
1913,XO Belgian Waffle,5,The staff is amazing Although the place is small they serve the best waffles I ordered a bubble gum shake and a coffee waffle Loved the taste It was crunchy on the outside and not completely soggy inside just the right way a waffle is supposed to be It was perfect so a big thumbs up
1914,XO Belgian Waffle,4,"The waffles are not overloaded with syrup
Has enough sweetness
Best with vanilla ice cream
Thought the waffles would be a bit bigger
The packaging for delivery is great"
1915,XO Belgian Waffle,4,I love waffles and I always order online from this place Im very happy with their delivered product and also its very tasty worth trying 
1916,Peppy Peppers,4,"Peppy Peppers is located near bday complex They serve fusion food and have loads of options to choose
The place is very vibrant and spacious A nice place to chill out and pocket too
The service was pretty quick 

 My Fav Picks

The hot chocolate was very satisfying 
Loved their different types of Nachos and Fries 
They are over loaded with cheese and veggieschicken with different dips 
The Thai green curry and Quesadillas are a must try 

 Should be Improved

The cheese sticks the cheese was quite hard It must be melted and soft
The pizzas didnt enjoy them much as the cheese was pretty hard

1919,Peppy Peppers,3,"Peppy Peppers is a new Cafe thats opened up in Banashankari Its actually a part of the Jalsa venture and is on the terrace I visited the place with a bunch of friends for dinner The ambience is pretty decent Its done with white chairs and has greenery all around The service is pretty slow and for some reason the place was smelling of garbage Not a nice feeling at all Im sure anyone will agree The pricing is okay Not too cheap and not too expensive
Coming to the Food we tried the Nachos with guacamole and this was really good I definitely loved this one It had coloured Nachos with guacamole and tasted delicious The cajun spiced potato wedges were too oily but tasted decent The Chilli cheese toast had too much of mayo than cheese but was decent nevertheless The taiwanese babycorn was way too sweetwith a bit of chilli here and there On the whole the place can be given a miss if you have other options in mind The Nachos though are really good Must try"
1920,Peppy Peppers,5,Wow I had a delightful experience at this cafe Everything is perfect here  absolutely delicious food  very pocket friendly  abundance quantity of food and very courteous management  you should definitely try their peppy peppers fries and their pizza Desserts here are bliss They gave us a dessert as complimentary I would recommend this to each and everyone who are looking for a pleasant experience
1921,Peppy Peppers,4,This new restaurant in the vicinity serves some great food The interiors of the restaurant jalsa previously is now renovated with a small twist to be known as peppy peppers They serve Mexican Chinese wood fire thin crust pizza and desserts too We visited this place for lunch a very cleanly maintained place I must say We tried the Mexican version of the manchow soup which was spiced right n soothing our palate we tried the Cajun spiced potato wedges which were too huge in portion n tasted good  we tried the fish manchurian on chefs recommendation and it tasted really good  for mains course we tried the spinach corn n mushroom sandwich which tasted good as well They have a section of mocktails too  We also tried the spicy peppers mocktails which was a guava based drink with chilly powder n crushed pepper  The staff were courteous enough n the service was a lil late  Will surely recommend to try this place and also Im looking forward to visit the place again 
1922,Peppy Peppers,4,Beautiful ambience quite spacious Service bit slow We had ordered veg quesadilla cottage cheese steak sizzler and a cafe latte Presentation of the food was nice Taste was good Coffee wasnt worth a penny it was bad

1926,Peppy Peppers,4,"Peppy Peppers is located right next to the BDA Complex in Banashanki It is situated right above Jelsa and so they also take Jelsa orders

We ordered Butter Chicken Fries here and DalMethi and Phulka from Jelsa

The Butter Chicken Fries was really good The fries topped with cheese and chicken tandoori I guess was really filling It is definitely enough for two

Overall it was a really good place with reasonable price

Peace"
1927,Peppy Peppers,3,"Good place with good food the prices are on the expensive side but thats okay as it makes for the quantity I recommend babycorn Thai manchurian cheesy fries peppy paneer

1928,Peppy Peppers,5,Just above Jalsa Peppy Peppers is relatively a new multi cuisine restaurant with a wide menu It has both indoor and outdoor seating spacious with colourful interiors We asked for staff reconnection in Veg and went ahead with Cajun Spice Potatoes Quesadillas Cottage cheese sizzler and some desserts They offer huge quantity and just two of us with my kid we felt overwhelmed All the dishes were cooked perfectly and tasted excellent We visited late for dinner and all the staff assisted us though it was after closing time Best place to hang out with friends and family Must visit for a reasonable price some what exotic menu 
1929,Peppy Peppers,4,"A beautiful place in BDA with very good menuThe seating arrangement and the service must be appreciated
Must try
Butter Chicken Fries this is enough to fill your tummy though the quantity of chicken is less in it it is very luscious the flavour of creamy and cheesy butter chicken is a perfect add on to your fries
Chicken Sizzlers it comes with potato wedges which are so crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside sliced vegetables perfectly cooked 2 slices of chicken rice and sizzling butter Rice was surely not the best thing it was okay but the chicken was too delicious
The only disappointment was there werent mocktails Only fruit punch was available and it was quite disappointing too

This was also good it had some indian masala on top of the nachos

Peppy peppers pizza
It had some Paneer and some stuff I did not enjoy the pizza The quantity was really less and the taste was not to the mark may be they have to work some more to make the taste better

I usually dont like thin crust pizzas but then I ordered one here and it was amazing We tried the peppy special pizza Though it had rajma in it it didnt disappoint us It was excellent
For starters we ordered cheesy fries and the quantity served was more than enough for three peopleThe pasta Alfredo was good nothing extraordinary abt it
The place has a colourful appeal to it and is very well maintained
Overall it was a really good experience and one must definitely not miss going to this place

It was just amazing Pizzas so good after such a long time The thin crust pizzas here are just a piece of paradise

2046,1947,4,"They are perfect in preparation of vegetarian dishes when we talk about North Indian food this is something which you cannot find in other restaurantsI have been to their Jayanagar outlet many times so I planned for dinner here this time I already a fan of 1947 for vegetarian dishes So this time I have tried Panner Tikka Dum Biriyani and Panner Lababdar gravy but this time I didnt liked Biriyani because its not actually a dum Biriyani taste like a regular Biriyani So Im cutting a rating for that apart from that everything was fine Its been a while and its a late review About the ambiance which is very desi Indian styled restaurant and all the staffs are very active in serving food dishes
So I will recommend this outlet to all veg food lovers"
2047,1947,4,"One of the best places for north India food lovers it being a veg only place makes it a great option while going with family

Lot of options to choose from

Service is very quick even though its always bustling with people the menu has improved a lot from when it was started

Have been many times  so not naming any dishes except for a few dishes all are well made and tastes good"

2049,Cake of the Day,4,Very good bakery good quality pastries Pastries are so soft and fresh and moist I love pineapple pastry and chocolate pastry here Cookies are okay
2050,Cake of the Day,4,Cupcakes so pretty and appealing They tasted less like cupcakes and more like pastries But the taste was delicious So no complaints Had the dark chocolate truffle and not to forget how pretty it looked Also had the pineapple cupcake  Ive also had the other pastries and savoury stuff here and theyre pretty good The chocolate mousse cup and the mushroom puffs are my favourite Not to forget the humble black forest I can vouch that they make one of the best and juciest black forest cakes Ive been having them since 2010 and Ive never been disappointed with it Do give it a try
2051,Cake of the Day,1,their cake was not fresh at all its base was so watery that we can squeeze the water from it not at all satisfied after paying so much for the cake
2052,Cake of the Day,1,Even after repeatedly asking fresh they said today morning prepared Birthday spoiled Even counter was empty they said preparing items Its not the case No quality no customer
2053,Cake of the Day,1,"This place is just beside Mane Thindi while heading towards Kamakya theatre If there was some reaction or emoticon bigger than dislike or angry face I would have given that to this place Its the WORST PLACE EVER I have my justification for it too You buy cakes for special moments but what happens if you discover hair yes you read it right HAIR in your cake and you begin puking out of disgust One of my special days turned into a disaster courtesy this place Wouldnt ever suggest it to anyone
Besides this the cakes are extremely sugary and watery the bread and puffs are average

2054,Cake of the Day,1,I purchased wheat bread on 15Apr which is manufactured on 15Apr and expiry on 18Apr It is cake of the day Ring road BSK 3rd stage Please see the photo of this bread Very concerned about food quality and safety

2056,Cake of the Day,3.5,We went on a rainy evening to hog some snacks We tried Choco Almond pastry Almond cake Assorted Puff and an eggless orange cake Cakes were too sweet Puff was oily Tastes were good
2057,Cake of the Day,4,"Best Cakes around the region of banashankari I like their Eggless cakes very much
Their menu of pastrys are pretty random but good to taste

Try out normal honey cakes here tastes really good

Bakery items such puffs buns and chips are little overly priced is what i feel

They have good customer service and faster delivery They do not have any seating arrangement or any ambience as its almost located next to main road

Would definitely recommend for Cakes"
2058,Cake of the Day,3.5,"I used to be  frequent visitor to this Cake Shop until a new better one came up within walking distance from my place

This particular branch is almost almost always crowded and there is hardly any parking space around here A bummer according to me Anyway the quality of their cakes is pretty good Their Black forest chocolate Mousse Chocolate truffle and Pineapple pasty are my favourites AMong the noncake stuff Spring roll puff and hot chat puff are worthy mentions

The prices are fair enough Do give it a try

2060,Cake of the Day,3.5,Cake of the day the one  on ring road is swarming with people I am so amused They have good number of eggless varieties and sometimes you find some unheard of flavours But this place is expensive specially when there are others like Just Bake Daily Bread who offer more elaborate decorations for the same price
2061,Cake of the Day,4,"If you are a sweet tooth and you have a craving to eat cake And you are a student of some college in that area   this is the place to be
The cakes are sumptuous and juicy Not at all dry Being a chocolate lover I can boldly suggest that even the fruit flavors are amazing
The savory items like the buns puffs and mini pizzas are super good
My favorite cake is the mango cake  3"
2062,Cake of the Day,3.5,I have been a frequent visitor to this place since it is quite near to my home and the college where I studied The place is neat hygienic the cakes are quite good And are priced quite economically compared to other cake outlets The salt biscuits are worth a special mention they are delicious And if you want a birthday cakethey usually have 34 cakes kept ready or you can get it custom made before hand too The cakes are affordable and light on the pocket definitely worth getting your birthday cakes from here
2063,Cake of the Day,5,Mane Thindi  Cake shop seems to  belong to the same owner as they have the same bags  packing etc  I would avoid the cake shop but the south indian snacks at tiffin center mane thindi next doors are really good He serves Dosas Idli Vada Shira chappatis  other stuff which lots of people come to have Most importantly the snacks are priced quite right here and dont seem like most other tiffin centers in Bangalore where they want  to make tons of profit these days Coffee is pretty good too Give it a try sometime I dont think you will be disappointed
2064,Cake of the Day,4.5,Most of the flavors of  cakes are quite mouth watering This is one of the best places Ive found in Bangalore for Cakes Of course their puffs specifically the paneer puff and other bakery items are quite tasty Its a place not to be missed incase you love cakes

2068,Cake of the Day,3.5,"Situated in the main ring road beside mane thindi katriggupe this is a decent bakery outlet
I havent taken any cakes home so far but I have tried the veg puff palya bun salt biscuits vanilla pastry and some butter biscuits They are neat and decent Fresh most important 

These bakeries are no less than your Butter sponge and VB and saves the efforts to travel until those famous bakeries

2071,Kabab Magic,4,One of the nicest places for non vegetarian food around Jayanagar The barbeque tandoor chicken was really nice and spicy The broast chicken was really crispy and delicious They add some extra masala on the top of the chicken to give it a spicy taste The Mayo served with barbeque chicken is the perfect thing to compliment the spicy barbeque chicken You need to have them hot once they are served as they usually they tend to dry once it becomes cold Overall a great experience 
2072,Kabab Magic,4,This outlet is close to my office and the other outlet in Rt Nagar is close to my residence Both the outlets have provided some mouth watering tasty dishesthe stand out among them are the shawarma roll n plate Biryani combo is also great Overall it is a place where you get to eat to the fullest and it provides justice to the money spent
2073,Kabab Magic,4,Giving 4 stars just for their shawarma which has been my fav since the 90s Along with the chicken shawarma ordered a parotta with half grilled chicken The grill chicken was a lil dry  not impressed

My only request is bring this franchise to Kolkata You wont regret as Bengalis are the connoisseur of good food"
2075,Kabab Magic,4,I ordered the biryani from here It was good in the taste and quantity was in more and quality was also good The biryani was good and the price was also less If you are hungry at night by 11 pm or 1130 pm you can order quickly Biryani was the bestseller of them Thank you
2076,Kabab Magic,1,Worst experience no courtesy to even call and tell they cannot deliver after one hour through Zomato chat I am told its still being prepared after me asking them y do u accept orders in the first place when u cant deliver this is one place I would never ever want to look at for dining or delivery
2077,Kabab Magic,3,The delivery was quick and the food was fine The size of the rolls should be reworked on as they are extremely small The Gobi Manchurian should be made a bit less spicy for people like me

2082,Namma Brahmin's Idli,3,"Had been to Brahmins for a Sunday breakfast A small shop that you can easily miss if not for the small crowd outside waiting for their turn No seating and very little space inside even to stand It opens very early at around 6 in the morning

But nobody really cares as the melt in the mouth thatte idlis more than make up for it Soft silky and buttery  it goes perfectly with the tangy chutneys tomato and the regular coconut We also tried the podi butter Idli which is thatte Idli smeared with butter and gunpowder The podi was different in taste than what Ive had earlier with a distinct tanginess to it The udad vada though was average

Tea and coffee were routine and good

Food

Ordered
Kung Pao Chicken
Murgh Beer House Tikka
Panneer Sofiyan Tikka

Well cooked and flavoured chicken The King Pao Chicken was my favourite The peanuts added a nice touch to the chicken making it crispy and soft all at once

Usually once you eat chicken panneer never can never meet your expectations However a special mention for the paneer Tikka The panneer was soft and definitely mouth watering Easily a good plate to remember

Murgh Beer House Tikka was no different than any starter Though the name stands out the dish had no flavour or taste that stood out and made us wonder about the ingredients But it was tasty alneit So no qualms about the food here"

Taste  I had ordered for a Paneer Masala Bowl and Makai Masala Bowl
The rice used in both the bowls were same Simple flavoured jeera rice with some ghee topped with seasoning of oregano powderolives and some colorful capsicum It blended really well with the curries 

Paneer Masala Bowl  The curry was well flavoured rightly spiced with great amount of paneer

Makai Masala Bowl  The curry was tangy and slightly on the sweeter side People like me who prefer less spicy food and are in love with corn can go for this bowl The ones who like spicy food would probably be disappointed with this one"
2110,The Good Bowl,5,"I was searching for a new restaurant which serves a fusion of Indian and Western food
The Good Bowl promised me a simple mix of flavours and unique ingredients all in a SINGLE BOWL

I ordered a Mac n Cheese Bowl along with Mughlai Chicken Rice Bowl with Omelette to taste both the Veg and Non Veg varieties

The box was packaged well and arrived hot The Veg Bowl with cottage Cheese was an instant hit with my team

The Omelette and the well cooked rice was a per fact mix Extra points for Black Olives and Jalapenos which are my personal favourite

If you want an executive meal and non messy meal with a mix of Proteins Carbs and Fibres"
2111,The Good Bowl,5,I ordered veg mac and cheese Loved it good taste and quantity Package also good would like to visit the outlet and definitely I recommend my all frnd
2112,The Good Bowl,5,Ordered veg Mac and Cheeseloved itgood taste and quantitypackaging also goodwould like to visit the outletand definately recommend 
2113,The Biryani Cafe,5,"People who are always on the hunt for biryanis with perfect spice balances must give a compulsory visit to the biryani cafe near Avalahalli BDA Park


Any spice can be felt best only if with marination and any dish which come to the table here undergoes a 4 hour marination process

The unique combination of spices makes this place very unique

Must try Paneer fry and mint cooler

2114,The Biryani Cafe,4,I have been here once and I tried chicken Basmati biryani the taste was good close to Hyderabadi Biryani but the gravy was not good ambiance is ok
2115,The Biryani Cafe,5,"A hidden gem serving the best Donne Biryani in town I should say this has been the best Donne Biryani I have had till date In fact Im tempted to go back and give a low rating to some of the other Donne Biryani restaurants
The Biryani Cafe Chicken Fry is an excellent starter and a very unique dish Crispy and hard on the outside and gets soft and juicy as you bite in Just the right amount of spicy and this starter goes well with the Pudina Juice
Donne Biryani is cooked to perfection the rice is cooked just well and the chicken pieces are softer and juicy A must have dish at this restaurant
The Dum Biryani was just on and I should say is not as tasty as the Donne Biryani
The ambience takes you to old Bangalore with one wall adorned with pictures of the city in the early 70s I guess Service is great and enjoyable"
2116,The Biryani Cafe,4,"Havent been to the restaurant but have ordered online many times
The Biryani is Authentic Karnataka style with the right amount of flavour and spice served that a light onion raitha they also have different variety of biryani Basmati
My favourite are jeer rice Biryani and The egg chilli
Decent price
Pocket friendly
Cheers to the whole team "
2117,The Biryani Cafe,4,"I went to this place in search of kothu poratta but when we reached they were like they dont have kothu poratta I was really disappointed and my friend told the thing  and they prepared it for us  the staffs were really good and I was happy  it was really goood  and plus damn spicy authentic kothu poratta
Loved every bit of it  never miss out on this"
2118,The Biryani Cafe,3,Highly recommended by a friend this cafe is situated within the streets of banashankari The ambience is pretty decent and has a rustic tinge of the past The food was good I had ordered paneer special fry The paneer was fried and roasted in butter The taste was unexpected and completely new to me The buttery taste with a slight sour flavor was slightly weird and nice at the same time I would recommend this place for chicken which my friend had and mushroom fry which is supposed to be delicious here
2119,Spicy Tandoor,4,cost for chicken rolls is very high but fine taste by pandey and is crew pls deduct the cost of rolls and great variety of food is been served
2120,Spicy Tandoor,5,Awesome taste feel rich taste of food cleanness is very good very friendly nature by the hotel person totally awesome all the best gud luck

2167,LSD Cafe,4.5,"Best latenight service I have experienced I ordered chicken tikka masala and breads like roomali roti and garlic butter naan The gravy was generous and delicous bit spicy and the naan and roomali Roti were hot soft and went well with the gravy
At 3 in the night their service exceeded my expectations Keep up the service"
2168,LSD Cafe,4,I wonder why this place has a 2 point something rating Didnt find anything wrong with the food The white sauce pasta was exactly how I specified it  creamy and with extra mozzarella The crispy babycorn chili tasted great but was not crispy because well it came in a container The food was delivered well within the time mentioned No complaints whatsoever And this is perfect for those late night hunger pangs
2169,LSD Cafe,1,"Ordered Chatpata Chana Chat Dal Makhani aloo parantha and butter roti
Strange fixation with salt  both the dal and the parantha were infused with salt to the point that both were bitter
If the chefs speciality is merely chopped veggies and poorly boiled Chana you know the place has a problem
Disappointed that I cant leave a lower rating"

So this time i wanted to try something different during lunchmy friend suggested to try triple fried rice here and Luckily i saw triple fried rice on the Menu board and ordered it

It was yummy It is combination of noodles and fried riceHowever noodles will be thin and crispy For every spoon you get crispy noodles which i liked it pretty much They dont accept cards and little crowded during lunch time It is Pocket friendlyrecommended for casual breakfast and lunch"

2304,Upahar Sagar,4,"What do i say about this place

1 Its near by my office05 km Its more or less like a lunch out place for me
2 Its basically on the KR road near the shastry bakery signal

Mind you its heavily crowded placeespecially during the lunch hours The biryani fried rice gobi manchuri over here is good The desserts there are quite yum I love the north indian thali which gives you soup cups of rice curd rice 3 curries 2 rotiskulchas fruit salad gulab jamunone of the best tomato soup for 90 bucks and the taste doesnt disappoint you

During my visits taste was consistent with zero complaints and most of the dishes they serve in breakfast menu are quite decent without burning your pockets There is no point of mentioning about particular dishes to try here everything is virtuous Its a selfservice restaurant with a couple of tables  chairs to sit and eat
There is nothing special about ambience here it looks similar to other Darshinis in Bangalore

2342,Meghana Foods,5,This is one of the best biryanis Ive ever had The Meghana special while chicken is still brilliant The tandoori chicken is also pretty great Looking forward to trying their mutton variants
2343,Meghana Foods,3,Service is too slow and need to wait for 1 hour for 30min for having food  they dont even take reservations properly and biryani is not that good compared to paradise biryani in terms of veg biryani
2344,Meghana Foods,5,"One of the best briyani I had at the end of 2018 


I had their special chicken briyani  mutton keema briyani The meghanabiryani is an Andhra style restuarant serving delicious nonveg dishes in Bengaluru The briyani was very tasty  the taste clearly showed theyve used only natural spices in briyani


Overall it was a great experience in Meghanas Restuarant So I would rate

2365,Krishna Sagar,1,Worst experience with Krishna sagar I ordered panner butter masala masala itself not good Even roti also it looks like chapati I never expected from this hotel Guys please never buy anything from this hotel I had thrown next moment
2366,Krishna Sagar,3.5,Quiet small place But food is nice and very cheap Looking out for cheap north indian food this is the place to visit Although negative point is taste varies day to day Some time food is great but some time it is worse Famous for his thali for the students nearby
2367,Krishna Sagar,1,We wanted to try everything in the area as we were new there I didnt wanted to go there seeing the smoke and cleaning but anyway we went Ordered combo thali ate 2 chapati and thats it We sworn not to come to this place anymore Ambiance is of course not good But unlike paratha house food is also not good I wouldnt recommend it
2368,Krishna Sagar,3.5,Very nice place for north Indian eat out But this place was not clean Food is fresh and they made against the order A best place for north Indian food lovers with low budget
2369,Krishna Sagar,3,"When just late to work eateries like this work on
Landed up here for breakfast which I did parcel took idli it was nice soft with chutney and sambhar
Prices are quite cheap
Place was clean and neat"

But food is fresh and made against the order
Nothing more to say about this place"
2371,Krishna Sagar,5,"Perfect place for engineering students in need of north indian food
Great food at very low prices bhindi masala n panner kolhapuri are a must try with butter chapaties
Dont expect ambience just enjoy the food"
2372,Krishna Sagar,3.5,A good place to have lunch or dinner almost everyday they provide tasty and good quality food at a very much affordable price dont keep your expectations high like the usual hifi restaurants it is a very small restaurant for the budget peopleThe main attractions are the combos and the thaali Rotis are made of wheat and is healthyGranite tables and granite benches are provided to sit and dine
2373,Krishna Sagar,3.5,North India food style Good in taste service also not bad with in budget good for casual lunch and dinner seating arrangement were not upto the mark
2374,Dessert Rose,5,Tried the rose and chocolate macaroon loved it  Crisp  soft and chewy with a delicious filling Rose macaroon is a must try  kudos to this one  it was perfectly balanced  Mild yet we get the hit of rose flavour  yum 
2375,Chickpet Donne Biryani House,4,One of the famous biriyani place everyone would love to eat  quality has decreased over time but still worth eating if the quality is maintained as it was years ago still can take first place

Had biryani rice and chicken pepper dry Their biriyani is quiet different from what other restaurants serve Its a different rice with some masala But it tastes amazing Worth having 1st time tried something different kind of biryani Chicken pepper dry was ok Didnt like much

Service is too fast We just ordered and within 5 mins they served

2379,Me And My Cake,1,Do not order anything This restaurant is so irresponsible they do not even answer calls I had ordered cake for my daughter birthday via zomato at 1154am however it was confirmed that the order will be delivered before 300pm same day However zomato does not know what to do and they say restaurant is not receiving our calls
2380,Me And My Cake,1,My order never reached me and the delivery boys number was never sent The guy who was coordinating with the order told me that Id receive my order in a while and stopped receiving my calls soon Really disappointed and dissatisfied after waiting for so long for a birthday cake to come and be disappointed and disappoint others on someones birthday Really bad service I wish I could rate a 0 for this place cause I didnt even get a chance to be positive and appreciate them for something atleast
2381,Thanco's Natural Ice Creams,2,"The place is definitely good for ice creams but talking about the concerns the manger is very rude
They do not treat customers well and behave in a very rude manner
No matter the ice creams and flavors are really good
A mannerism is important"
2382,Thanco's Natural Ice Creams,4,I am in great love with natural ice creams This branch especially maintains a wide variety of flavours and close to my place One of my favourite in recent times is the gulkand flavour A good place to hang out for an ice cream and is maintained well

"
2387,Ayda Persian Kitchen,5,The food is really great The atmosphere is really Okay The prices are perfectly fine The quantity is a lot for your money I would recommend this restaurant
2388,Ayda Persian Kitchen,4,"For all the meat lovers specifically this place is a must visit for Persian delicacies
The ambience is rustic and beautiful
Not very often will you find the place too crowded
Do ask for assistance with the order unless u are accompanied by Iranian friends"
2389,Ayda Persian Kitchen,4,Tried their joojeh kobideh and hasiri dishes All were really good and different This place near bda complex stands out among the competition Restaurant is empty more often than not and people prefer take away to dine in
2390,Ayda Persian Kitchen,5,Omg really good here Totally worth it You guys have to try this place if you are fan of Arabicish kind of food And totally worth the money
2391,Ayda Persian Kitchen,3.5,This place is slightly difficult to find even though it is exactly near BDA First of all the restaurant was completely empty which didnt give us the correct impression that the eatery is doing well We ordered the Kobideh Kebab It came with a huge platter of Basmati Rice and some curry to accompany with it It was my first time with Persian Cuisine so cant verify the authenticity but the taste was really good It was really filling and I feel it was a good value for money It would obviously have been better if we had fellow visitors at the restaurant Otherwise a good place to visitAmartya Amit Baran Roy
2392,Ayda Persian Kitchen,3.5,Had a plate of Sulthani Not sure if it was authentic Persian but it tasted good indeed Its a nice place with kind and generous people The Persian dishes seems to be a little overpriced
2393,Ayda Persian Kitchen,3.5,If ur looking to try some persian cuisine  U should try this place Although almost everything on the menu is yummy nd nice its better to go with some iranian friends at least for the first time to guide u on what to order you could also ask for suggestions once you go to the restaurant  The menu includes some of the foods pictures to get a better idea on how the food looks like  since you wont know what the names mean and what kind of food it will be read the menu and ask the waiter then go for it The food is very nice and kebabs will be served with red cabbage pickles lemon piecesonion ringsbarbecued tomato  Rice or naan according to ur choice Your order doesnt take too long to come  Ive been to this place many a times and definitely recommend this place for all the foodies who love trying different kinds of food and different cuisins 
2394,Ayda Persian Kitchen,5,"Love love love their food Ive been ordering food from Ayda for over 2 years now and have never been disappointed My go to menu is kabab sheshliks korma sabzi and hummus The lamb is perfectly cooked juicy and succulent I can usually just eat their plain rice well plain Its that good Dont forget to try their mast mosar  Its a lovely creamy yogurt with a hint of garlic
Whats more their service is amazing"
2395,Ayda Persian Kitchen,3,very good food nice ambiance but prices Lil High compare to facilitation
2396,Ayda Persian Kitchen,2.5,"average food we ordered joojeh lohmei a chicken dish Chicken was very dry for my palate
Ambience  AC does not work Light switches off is middle of dinner
All in all an average restaurant Would not visit again"
2397,Ayda Persian Kitchen,3.5,"If you are looking for a good PersianIranian food  than Ayda is the place

Ambiance355
Located on the first floor opposite BDA complex this restaurant is hard to find The restaurant is quite small  can hardly accommodate 20 people The interior ambiance is spartan and is purely functional Normally this restaurant is not crowded and I have seen only Arab students in this restaurant

Service 455
The waiters and captain are very courteous very helpful and are eager to serve you The restaurant area being a small place helps in getting a great service

Coming to food 45 I find the food very authentic Like traditional Iranian cuisine  the food is primarily centered around meat and kababs Food is nonspicy and yet quite flavorful

Overall this is a good place to go for a change or if you are looking for a good PersianArab food"
2398,Ayda Persian Kitchen,5,i liked it because i regularly go the one in church street  they have maintained the same taste in both branchesfor my review you may check the church street review whihc i posted
2399,Chatar Patar,4,Ive had food from Chatar Patar many times My favourites here are the corn and mayo sandwich and the dahi papdi chat The place is clean economical and super quick service Id definitely recommend this place
2400,Polar Bear,4,My Go to place for late night dessert cravings especially when I dont feel like driving out Usually call for a Death By Chocolate to be delivered and it still tastes extremely good Only rivaled by Corner House the chocolate cake within the DBC is made really well They serve the chocolate sauce separately in a parcel which stays hot and tastes good All in all a must try where ever you stay And dont hesitate to order in
2401,Polar Bear,3,The taste which is similar like every other polar bearThe ambience is quite nice and a cozy place to recommendThis store is bigger compared to other polar bear store but the service is not quite good as the staff is not polite and little rude and impatient
2402,Kidambi's Kitchen,4,If you are looking for pure south Indian authentic food in Bengaluru then this place is amazing My first visit to Bengaluru and first restaurant in the city and really happy with the food One suggestion for everyone please wait till last dish to come because they have good variety in buffet
2403,Kidambi's Kitchen,3,Centrally located restaurantReasonably priced menufairly decorated atmosphere Average quality food and poor service Should increase quality and variety of food
2404,Kidambi's Kitchen,4,"they serve authentic kannada iyangar style food which very tasty and good and neat

2406,Kidambi's Kitchen,2.5,"Decent Roof Top ambience
Taste of the food wasnt bad but it wasnt quite exquisiteauthentic either  We have certainly had tastier South Indian meals elsewhere Restaurant wasnt even half full on a Saturday afternoon
All in all theres nothing exceptional about this place"
2407,Kidambi's Kitchen,1.5,"Doesnt offer what is marketed
Serves you cold dry food for which is superior be a lunch only place  thali 
Not good on taste quality and and priced heavy
2 overall
No recommendation"
2408,Kidambi's Kitchen,3.5,Good location wish they put the fans on when they saw their customers sweating Food was good south indian food with mild spice levels Service was good as well but sometimes they would put food for only some people at the table and not ask the others
2409,Kidambi's Kitchen,1,This second floor restaurant has a vast space comfortable seating The place has no breeze even though it is a rooftop restaurant They do not even have good fans we were sweating throughout the course of our eating All side dishes were pathetic except one kurma for the late arrival poories The rice was gastric flavoured the service was so pathetic that the guys were asking for a translation for every dish needed The management was rubbish
2410,Kidambi's Kitchen,4,"Had visited this place on a Sunday afternoon 30th April 2017 and found it sparingly occupied at 2pm

I think food prepared here changes daily and depends on the day We were served beetroot palya heerekai kootu kosambarichutneychapatipuliyogerechilly bajji papadcurdbuttermilkshavige paaysaricerasamsambar and majjige huli

The only thing that was not good was the chilly bajji as it was cold and it was bit oily Rest of the items were very good All the items clearly tasted like home cooked food

Service was also good and didnt feel it was slow They property attended to serve when items were getting empty"
2411,Kidambi's Kitchen,3.5,This indeed was a pleasant surprise Probably the best of the lot in BSK 2nd stage for vegetarian meal Ambience is simple and nice The poori and saagu was the highlight of the meal I got to know that generally they serve chapathis but the day we went they had pooris The HuliSambar was very good SaaruRasam could have been better Shavige payasa Happalapapad mensinkai bajjimirchi were all good too Food served on plantain leaf is always a delight Definitely a winner on hand

2435,Kidambi's Kitchen,3.5,Kidambis Kitchen a rooftop restaurant You get tat refreshing feel when you enter the restaurant Traditional south Indian meals served on plaintain leaf The food was good The service was good n the staff was friendly too The meal is unlimited Value for your money and last but not the least the desert was awsm 
2436,Mane Thindi,3,Ambience might not be the greatest suite but the dosas are But next time try filtering cockroaches outta your upma coz its disgusting to find one in middle of a hogging
2437,Mane Thindi,4,"Its a main road facing self service with limited place hotel near 1947 100 feet ring road

Food is amazing
Open dosa and coffee to finish off"
2438,Mane Thindi,2,Quality  taste got degraded day by day This is not earlier famous Mane Thindi anymore Not worth to visit this Better to go across 05 km ahead is the best Thaaza Thindi
2439,Mane Thindi,3.5,Combo is the best item to have in this place  good taste and coffee tastes good ambience is not that good but for a quick bite it is ok to have here
2440,Mane Thindi,3,Average place for having quick south Indian bites It is located on the main road near Kamakya theatre and can be easily locatedThe service is fast and you wont have to wait long for the food There are no seating arrangements except a few tables to stand and eatThe taste is averagemany places serve better at the same rateThe chief concern is the hygiene of the place which is very poor The staff should try to improve the situation
2441,Mane Thindi,3.5,An affordable place to have quick South Indian bitesThey offer a number of dosa varieties and snacksThe place is always jam packed and they do not have seating optionsThe service is really fast and you wont have to wait much even when it is crowdedPersonal favourites are the Benne Masala dosa and Avarakalu dosaHighly recommended if you are on the look for tasty bites at affordable rates
2442,Mane Thindi,3,"Located on the main road when youre travelling from DG Petrol bunk towards Kamakya theatre its easily identifiable with a huge board stating its name Its a small eating joint with no seating area availableThe food is average compared to the prices They do have delivery system available and the packaging is neat My concern cropped up with a couple of my colleagues fell ill after eating from Mane ThindiSohygiene could be one of the concerns However I didnt face anything as such personally till now
If youre looking for a quick breakfast or snack you can give it a try"
2443,Mane Thindi,4,"Had the jumbo thindi combo 

Contains Idly small dosa vada etc

All tasted good Crowd was more though

If you are near Kamakya or BSK its must visit "
2444,Mane Thindi,2.5,Cost is more Food qty not worth
2445,Mane Thindi,3,"Average Had an avarekalu dosa somewhat of a seasonal specialty but was strictly so so Either the dosa bater or the masala had too much salt Overall not bad but nothing great

abyventurawordpresscom"
2446,Mane Thindi,4,Brilliant place for a quick breakfast If youre the filling food freak theres a good option called the jumbo tindi which is really good for what it costs Also Bread Averakalu dosa are must tries
2447,Mane Thindi,3,The place serves the typical South Indian food Along with idli and vada tried the bread and avarekalu dosa It was good and worth the money However crowded most of the time
2448,Mane Thindi,3.5,A good place to have a quick breakfast The place is crowded sometimes and there is no seating arrangement I tried marsala dosa and idli  vada and I liked both
2449,Mane Thindi,2.5,"Pathetic service I ordered for an Open Dosa and they didnt give me Sagu the Veg Kurma I requested the person he was very arrogant and told me in kannada sagu kodalla means i will not give Sagu
Pathetic service all waiters have huge attitude problem not at all clean"
2450,Mane Thindi,3.5,"Its just like every other small selfservice joints Usually too crowded The food is pretty decent but not exceptional The prices are quite low which is a bonus The place is quite hygienic too

Ill just give it a general rating Its too common to warrant sectionwise ratings"
2451,Mane Thindi,3.5,"Do not get fooled by the board its just regular darshini they serve usual idli dosakarabath etcbut thing I love the most is the breakfast combo 
You get also almost all the breakfast items on it and price is also lessthe taste of the food is pretty good items like dosa they havent mastered it yet the dosa is either roasted too much or less or perfect it keeps varying but given the fact its one of the few darshini in banashakari area its definitely a thumbs up from sideprices are nominal Ambience is good  self service only no seating place the place is extremely clean and the service quite fast although its crowded during weekend morning rush hour do visit this restaurant if your in the areaor passing through devegowda petrol bunk"

2555,Floured-Baked With Love,5,One day my wife said we needed to celebrate our daughters half year birthday I said Okthe search was then on for the perfect cake We came to know of the couple who run this home style bakery from our relative the community where they stay have Floured as their regular baker for specialty cakes They delivered us a red velvet cake with vanilla butter icing with a cute sculpture on top The cake was moist and the icing made with real butter It was so good that we saved the leftover for ourselves rather than sharing it with others which was the actual plan  It is undoubtedly one of the best I have had till now A big heartfelt thanks to Anitha and Keshav for the special cake for the special occasion
2556,Floured-Baked With Love,4,"When I was looking up for some homemade innovate cakes for my brothers birthday I found this page on Facebook I was take by surprise to see cakes which had intricate decorations but made to perfection
It is run by Anitha and Keshav Its been 8 months and almost for every birthday and marriage of my family I have ordered cakes from here I have been impressed with the designs and taste
The best cake so far has been chocolate cake with vanilla cream If you want go with less sugar for cakes or icingcream they will do it as per requirement They even delivery it to the required place Even though it is little costly but surely it is worth every penny

Surely one should order from here"
2557,Floured-Baked With Love,5,I ordered a customized vanilla cake with chocolate buttercream for my fiance who lives in Bangalore Since I dont live in Bangalore I opted to go through zomato for a decent bakery to get the cake delivered I was worried how it would turn out to be and whether it would be delivered in midnight or not but keshav and anitha did a fab job The cake turned out to be exactly like I wanted and was delivered right on time My fiance loved the cake which had a human topper with a video game console and beer bottles since he is a big video game buff and said it was delicious Very happy to choose floured Thanks for the experience keshav and anitha

So second time around for my parents 40th wedding anniversary I decided to go to her again She was very accommodating considering my mom is a tad bit picky   and gave the right suggestions to make the perfect cake The cake looked absolutely gorgeous I got a vanilla cake with a layer of vanilla icing and chocolate ganache layers in between topped with vanilla icing My parents loved it It looked so delicious as well"

2580,Cakes & Slices,4,I am a frequenter of this place  Located on the main road of Srinivasnagar 80ft road a little ahead of Bata Showroom and Reliance fresh this place for sure is known to the residents there and is a popular place for the school tuition children in the area It is a bakery yes but the shininess and cleanliness of this place is welcoming you have a couple of chairs to sit and eat your cakessnacks  I personally love their Vanilla pastry strawberry pastry Chocolate pastry The palya aloo bun khara bun is equally good They used to have Pizzasburgers which were really worth the money and tasty too but not sure if they still have it on their shelves The Bread toasts are also a must try So if you are around this area and want to grab some instant bites go straight to cakes and slices and indulge in quickreasonable nibbling with no qualms
2581,Cakes & Slices,4,"Undoubtedly best bakery in Srinivasnagar  Bank Colony area Im a sincere customer to this bakery from past 2 years It is located opposite to Panchami on 80 feet main road between Srinivasnagar and Bank Colony bus stops

Ambiance is really cool as soon as you enter aroma of fresh baked bread welcomes you Its completely air conditioned floor and every thing is showcased in a great manner 

They serve awesome pastries fresh cream cakes donuts mousse cakes choco lava various kinds of puffs rolls and chocolates Every item is too good It is far better compared to many popular bakery in the area like Kaggis The price is quite low considering the quality and ambiance

Im a big fan of their pastries and Im ordering with them from past 2 years Till now I havent observed a single flaw in taste Each time it delights me just the way it delighted me in my first visit

This bakery is highly recommended for its consistent quality

Ordered 2 Paneer Rolls and a Chicken Fried RiceBoth were tasty and fulfiling
Service was swift and the place is clean and hygienic"
2583,Spice 9,5,Best shawarma roll and chicken 65 I have had in Bangalore The roll especially was perfect It was obvious that ingredients used were of good quality
2584,Spice 9,5,"Excellent food and Service
I live in an area with not many restaurant options but this place is certainly up to the mark
Went during the lunch time with my friend and had Chicken Dum Biryani and Chicken Kolapuri
The Biryani was probably the best I have had in a long timeChicken Kolapuri was also rich in flavour and taste
The rates seem quite reasonable for the the quality of food offered and ambience"

Ordered Chicken Biryani and Chicken 65Both were deliciousHeard there Shawarma Rolls are good too
All the staff are courteous and the place is clean and well maintained"
2586,Hari Super Sandwich,1,I have been here many times when it was located in bda to have crispy n crunchy sandwiches but now they have shifted to another shop at present the taste of sandwichs are pathetic i never expected this
2587,Hari Super Sandwich,1,"For once known to be serving one of the best sandwich s in Bangalore to this The quality has gone really bad They have increased the prices and have replaced the cheese slices with the modest portion of mayo for almost all of their sandwiches

They also cheap out in adding tomatoes or any other vegetables for chats and you actually need to tell the guy to add all that He bluntly says he cannot Talk about customer service

The quality and experience has really come down and I would recommend to not go there due to this experience"
2588,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,3,Place is situated on a road side ppl allergic to pollution and dust should avoid this place Hygiene must be improvedfood is pretty good here and reasonable egg Maggie here is my favorite
2589,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,2.5,A small place just behind bmsce Its damn cheap But few might wont like its hygiene They serve north Indian and Chinese If you are damn low on cash and in the area you can give a visit
2590,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,3,Anda ka funda is place to visit to have some aloo paratha Typical North Indian in style this eatery has some good amount of items with eggs A takeout by many means the hygiene is a compromise here Do visit if you live nearby and want to have to hot parathas
2591,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,1,"Id not suggest this place to anyone
There is absolutely no Hygiene
Place stinks  The place is run by a Couple  their year old baby
Places like this should be shut down by The Hygiene Department If there was one in India Before the food gives Bangalore diarrhea

Known for hostelites throwing eggs on it"
2592,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,3.5,cheap and best i guess  tasty food  quick and friendly service  place is a bit small  but enough for a fast food place i guess 
2593,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,2.5,Used to go there frequently a couple of years ago Hygiene is very poor They have a good verity of food The prices are dirt cheap Last resort place I would say
2594,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,2,"You will get lot of varieties in  egg and paratha Despite having good taste there is 0 hygiene and clean
You will suffer after dinning here so please dont go here looking at its menu and eye catching price tag"
2595,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,3.5,The place is very small  Hygiene is not properly maintained  The food provided is tasty and service is fast But the place is dirty to have lunch  Good for less money and to have lunch alone and fast
2596,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,3,Its a place for students and bachelors Lot variety of egg items are available but you need to stand on not so clean street or be seated on plastic chairs on foot path But a nice place if you are OK with compromise on location for taste
2597,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,3,All my non veg friends only egg is available here no other animal so be prepared to have a lot of egg and hygiene is really not ok and taste is also kind of average
2598,Atithi Point Ande Ka Funda,2.5,"Its a nice n cheap place but not so hyginicits mainly gud 4 snacks Its a nice place to go with frnds but gets very clummsythe bst item here u can get in my opinion r d parathas Egg roll is also gudbst for all age gps and with all companies

2603,K27 - The Pub,4,Convenient and Average Prices a neighbourhood bar for guys to get a quick drink or sit back and enjoy buddy company I have never seen families here Its most suitable for stag and solo parties Good Food and fast service
2604,K27 - The Pub,5,"Ambience is good Best food and i loved the taste of panner ghee roast and palak panner And budget friendly And its my all time favourite place in bangalore Service was good
Please provide some different kinds of brands in beers like tuborg Carlsberg etc"
2605,K27 - The Pub,4,Had been to this place recently there is smoking and non smoking zone They offer draught beer pitcher at 300 which is great and also the starters were good If you want to have a pocket friendly session then you can go to this place Ladies might feel uncomfortable with this place as it doesnt have a great ambience like that of other famous ones
2606,K27 - The Pub,1,Worst ambience ever experienced Poor service And food quality Dont take a chance else regret for that Only the name is pub but nothing near to pub its purely a local bar Not at all for family
2607,K27 - The Pub,3,Visited this place after a long time Its a two floor setup with average ambience They have indoor and outdoor seating Ordered Budweiser Chicken uruwal Egg Pakora Tandoori Roti Egg masala and Chicken Kolhapuri The food on the whole was reasonably good Service was quick Food is reasonably priced but charging 230 for a bottle of Budweiser is too high when the ambience is taken into consideration
2608,K27 - The Pub,5,"So yeah been to this place without much expectations First impressions you will see a local bar just beside the entrance to the pub  which is really bad   Dont judge already 
Once you enter you will understand by the ambience and aroma of the place how good it is  Two sections basically smoking and nonsmoking  Smoking section is a desi one or else you can call it as a Well maintained Dhaba and the other Non smoking section  which we just had a glimpse  was a shady place with a descent view across  Consist of TV and other fancy things and music was perfect 
The Price here are pocket friendly  as we saw this price list through zomato before  we expected the food and beer to be bad  indian bruhh  But it wasnt that bad  Service was best actually  dint notice any one speaking English but for people who know kannada  they treat you well 
Rated 5 mainly for the location and service 
Thank you"
2609,K27 - The Pub,1.5,"I can say that its the only pub near monotype which has both outdoor seating and indoor seating Its like some local bar with dark lit indoors The seating is just average It is mainly for the lot of people who want to hang around with cheap liqour as they have happy hours for great friendships
They hardly have strong beers so we had a premium 11 pitcher and it wasnt upto the mark either You cannot rely on the food here as it wont be any relish to the tastebuds"
2610,K27 - The Pub,1,"I had a very bad experience with K27 today They have renovated and made the price of the beer picture to Rs450 from Rs 325 But the worst part when i visited in d afternoon yesterday I asked for tissue paper and the waiter gives me cut news papers like in some local bar 
I asked the waiter to call the cashiermanager they never turned up when i went to pay the bill and found and complained he was so arrogant and dint even apologize When i said i will write a review about this he says do what ever you want and he is not scared Please see the pics as well"
2611,K27 - The Pub,4,"Beer is really cheap  happy hours 11 beer kf
Food was average and chicken drumstick was nice at 130 rs I likes the environment inside cool and nice place to have fun bar tender was friendly"
2612,K27 - The Pub,3,Ambience on the inside is average Their outside sitting place is poorly planned The stone seats dont have back rests Service was poor as well Prices are affordable and its someplace youd want to go to enjoy without ripping a hole in your pocket
2613,K27 - The Pub,3,"Firstlythe beer is damn cheap Cheap isnt even the word Its as cheap as buying a ac bus ticket So just scoot to this place when you are short on money But but butthe service sucks Sucks real bad Very arrogant people out there Food is average Rates are again cheap when you compare it to other pubs Ambience is okayish and could be much better

2619,Bengaluru Coffee House,4,being unwell I dont feel like eating anything and who wants to eat food from the hostel mess idli was the only option Bengaluru coffee house delivered Amazing idlis at very cheap cost however 30 tax was added which doubled the cost of idli thank you to Zomato offers I got reasonable discount

2622,Coffee Bytes,3.5,I vist here almost every day as its close to my office As mentioned above the service has to be improved a lot and the taste never remain constant too too slow people If the coffee is light when asked they make it strong thats not and issue
2623,Coffee Bytes,1,"I was tempted to go in with the assumption that this might be the next hotspot for hot idly and shtrong filter kaapi I was sadly mistaken I could barely complete the plate of idly I took and the coffee tasted very light
Not at all good Avoid"
2624,Coffee Bytes,4.5,"Had a conversation with the cashier who was more than happy to spill the beans on the coffee bytes story I mentioned that it had garnered poor reviews online and he told that the head cook was changed recently

In complete contrast to the opinions given so far the idli was good today We were a group of 5 and all of us would definitely recommend the masala dosa The sagu needs some work Chutney is good A good place to spend time with friends"
2625,Coffee Bytes,3,"Coffee Bytes is the newly opened quick breakfast joint in Hanumanthanagar I happened to visit here within 15 days after they opened Its a selfservice joint with limited breakfast menu which includes Idly Vada Kharabath Kesari bath and Coffee

In recent times there are so many joints opened like Coffee Bytes and food is brilliant But here everything has to be improved Idly was totally taut where the Vada was lack of crispiness Kharabath was bland too

Folks at Counter are bit arrogant and service is slow Place is nicely maintained with decent dcor Food is decently priced and one of the value for money joints for the south Indian breakfast

bangaloreepicurecom"
2629,Parjanya Chat Zone,2.5,"This new shop is aimed at those wanting a quick snack light on the pocket Definitely the target group is the students around BSK BDA Complex It comes to life like many other foodie places in the area in the evenings with a limited range during the day
The potatoonastick seems to be its USP but I have not tried that The veg sandwich was grilled well and had plenty of fresh salad veggies when I bought it the first time However the quality of its fare is not consistent The chaats especially are disappointing The counter has some nicelywrapped chocolates in a wide variety of flavours which are good though they can be more reasonably priced Seating is a couple of chairs outside and sitting inside is cramped"
2630,Parjanya Chat Zone,3,The Tea here is really good especially the ginger tea and ginger lemon tea and they make it better than the nearby SLV or nandini Cannot vouch the same for their coffee though Remember to ask for nominal sugar in the tea as they have a tendency to make it sweeter than required They have 51 variety of teas and some of them are quite unique Coming to the food the place is not exactly up to mark Chaats are ok not so great Some items like samosa and aloo tikki seem to be stale I like the gulab jamun which is available occasionally and is usually fresh The place is near BDA Complex and gets a lot of crowd in the evening The outlet is cramped with too many counters trying to sell several items in a very small space The seating isnt sufficient and the seats inside give a claustrophobic feeling The outdoor seating is still better inspite of the traffic and noise
2631,Parjanya Chat Zone,4,"Well well Sandwiches chats Burgers variety of teas juices all in one place 
probably the only place which has it all One stop This is opposite Jalsa on the same lane as SLV Swadishta

2637,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,2,"The first time i visited Kwality Walls i straight away wanted to try something new and that was  Chill Grill choose your flavors and the ice cream in beaten up on ice sheet marble and served in a cup I chose Tutti Fruti  and Fruit  Nut which were creamilicious Sometime later I ordered the same two and they did not taste anything like before Their Swirls are not my favorite McD has better ones
 
The poor rating goes to the way the place is handled Firstly the place is always empty  Secondly the staff is rude moody and unprofessional sometimes unhygienic too Third the TV is always on and the staff are the only ones who watch it They are least bothered about customers Its located in such a prime area and they have such good space but i feel its being wasted Why is the management so ignorant and not doing anything about it despite poor rating for all 3 outlets"

2639,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,4.5,nice place to hang out with friends  always liked this place  and the ice cream is really good and tasty on par with the likes of baskin robbins and swensens from our domestic company  they maintain good hygiene and quality
2640,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,1.5,This was my 1st visit to this branch terrible experience from the guy who prepares Firstly he is not familiar with Kannada or English So communication issues Next we ordered Cornetto Fresh fruit he gave it very quickly But it had nothing but only some ice cream and very few pomegranates According to the menu it says Swirl Strawberry and Choco biscuits in the tip But this guy never replied for watever we asked which was not there in the swirl Fresh fruit swril is famous for Strawberry which is not a seasonal fruit its available all time Very bad Never expected this kinda service kwalitywalls address this please
2641,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,3.5,"People have mixed feelings about this place As per me Kwality Walls is still a best along with other Ice Cream Brands I had my first Choco Bar from Kwality Walls only Well The Kwality Walls Swirls in BSK look like a flagship outlet with pretty decent interiors I love their Strawberry Butterscotch  Kesar Pista at any point of time They have umbrella chairs  bean bags outside  inside They should probably work on pricing part since the prices are too expensive I recommend this place

2642,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,2.5,"This place is located in a corner off Banashankari BDA complex Nice little place with a pleasing ambience with tables under an umbrella on the outside They provide quick service too

Now coming to the ice creams themselves theyre quite disappointing They do not even compare to other popular parlours like Corner House or Baskin Robbins The prices though still remain premium as always

Not really worth visiting

2643,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,4.5,Had the best Kesar pista ice cream Never expected this quality from Kwality walls Heard the swirls to be their signature to be my next cone to dive in
2644,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,2.5,A good place to hang out and spend sometime but the ice creams does not compliment Nothing admirable in the likes of great chains of ice cream parlours in Bangalore
2645,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,1.5,"More ice than cream
The problem with Kwality Walls is that firstly it doesnt even contain the minimum quantity of milk to be called ice cream and it is rather slyly labeled as a  frozen dessert 
Nowhere on the carton do they mention the words  ice cream It mainly consists of hydrogenated vegetable oil water and a small about of dehydrated milk Which is an utter disappointment
I believe only in Naturals Corner House and Baskin Robins do you get good quality ice cream that doesnt leave you bloated because of the hydrogenated oils

I had ordered a chocolate milkshake which tasted watered down and not at all worth the money they charged

Service was fine Ambience is good too Hence the extra 05 stars Although I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their food"
2646,Kwality Wall's Swirl's Happiness Station,3,"Nice serve

But there is no different varieties were u can choose the good
I had some problem wit the menu

2651,Sri Murari Family Restaurant,4,This tiny mess near kathriguppe signal packs a punch when it comes to Andhra meals They serve hot meals with tasty PAPPU dhal with spinach and ghee it waters Ur mouth right   They also serve non vegetarian like briyani and methi chicken
2652,Sri Murari Family Restaurant,5,This has become my go to place now for lunch The Andhra meals that they provide are to die for Biriyani is also superb But the standout performer for me is the Sholay kabab It is perfectly spiced with a tangy twist in the mouth Looks droolworthy as well
2653,Anna Kuteera,3,This our go to place for food in Banashankari Any time this restaurant is busy and the food quality is maintained We have tried almost all dishes here Affordable by everyone Service is quick Team management is awesome across the floors Self service From morning breakfast to dinner you can choose this place Even we have ordered online also The packing good and leakproof until it reaches home
2654,Anna Kuteera,3,"An ideal place for a quick bite Udupi foods served quick is their USP There are two sections a selfservice wing on the ground floor and an AC service hall on first floor

I like the idly vada dosa items and filter coffee for breakfast Thali is best for lunch and dinner especially when you are in a hurry

North Indian Rotis and palav are also available but i have not tried it

The only reason I am giving a 3 star rating is because the food is average nothing outstanding in taste nor is it bad its just about average clean good food and on budget"
2655,Anna Kuteera,3,Decent place for a quick bite Nothing great Food taste is just ok Might get crowded on weekends They also offer unlimited meals for Rs 150

2658,Anna Kuteera,1,"Worst falooda of my life till date To start with it was kulfi falooda and there was no kulfi what was in there was water frozen with flavour of kulfi there was no cream no dry fruits nothing close to a original kulfi
It was rare to find falooda in it ok amount of chia seeds little tuti fruti at the bottom
It was not even sweet I have to add ruafza to make it edible

Overall people just avoid and dont dare to try falooda of this place Previously we have tried there stick kulfi that was also not good and we have to throw that after few bites I think this place is not for sweets My search for good falooda still continue"
2659,Anna Kuteera,3,Ordered the masala dosa from Anna Kuteera didnt seem or taste too great Overall it lacked something and am not able to pinpoint exactly what Have heard that the meals here is great have to go one day to try that out and maybe then my rating would change
2660,Darbar,3,I visit this place most often with my friends This is a budget restaurant and always choose the rooftop The dishes served here are good
2661,Darbar,4,What I love about this place is the food although it doesnt have much space inside Their chicken appetizers are great the fried rice and biryani served here also delicious
2662,Vijayalakshmi,4,Nice restaurant for south indian snacks and dose Good chats but quantity is less We tried Mangaluru bonda chats and coffee Quick preparation of food self service
2663,Vijayalakshmi,4,This is just opposite to our house and we have been there more than 20 timesLiked their Idly vada set dosas and Masala dosas Tried Poori and chaat alsoLiked all dishes But manchow soup was not Good Channa Batura wasnice Their south Indian Thali is nice and very reasonablePrices are affordable Bought oarcel roti and Panner Masalait was good As its jump its a Saviour joint for us
2664,Vijayalakshmi,3,"Had got a coffee and Rava Idli Rava idli was very soft and fresh it came with a potato saagu and a Chutney both being very good Coffee was great as well However they can improve on their aesthetics near the juicesweets section as it looked a bit shabby apart from it everything was pretty neat
Looking forward to try other dishes"
2665,Vijayalakshmi,3,"Food taste is good
The service is not so good
They take too much time for serving even when the crowd is less

2666,Sri Udupi Food Hub,3,"Had been here with family for an evening dinner the ambience resembles that  of UD chain but is certainly lot more spacious we went to the service hall on first floor ground floor has selfservice
We ordered the following items  French fries Gobi Manchurian Plain Dosa Set Dosa Rava Idly
Except for Gobi Manchurian everything else was prepared well and tasted good gobi manchurian  didnt feel fresh and was bit hard
Pricing is very reasonable and service is very good as well"
2667,Sri Udupi Food Hub,5,"This place has never disappointed me till Now I really like their chaats always crispy tasty and enjoyable
Quick Service and value for money place"
2668,Sri Udupi Food Hub,4,Been to the darshini section on ground floor They have service on 1st floor Place is clean and crowd is good Ordered idli vada masala dosa and coffee Masala dosa was good yet expensive Coffee needs a lot of improvement Will surely drop by to try their north Indian stuff on 1st floor soon VFM 4 on 5 taste 4 on 5 ambience 5 on 5 Service 5 on 5 A really good addition to Jayanagar area Try it
2669,Sri Udupi Food Hub,5,So was in the mood for veggie delights and stopped by the place for some dosa I was taken aback by the mouth watering dosas these guys make really loved it you have to stop by if youre in the neighborhood to try this

We had been here for lunch today The place is stuffy and not ventilated
It was sweet corn soup chicken 65 mushroom masala and some butter kulchas that we ordered Sweet corn was on average but I felt the sweet corn was too old The chicken 65 masala was a bit raw and sour The mushrooms in mushroom masala werent fresh Kulchas were edible"
2711,Roll N Rock,3,Ordered paneer roll through zomato through these guys Well I wouldnt say I was completely satisfied n neither would I say I was dissatisfied Just a feeling of could have been better Paneer was soft n nice n the paratha was aptly cooked I kind of felt let down by the filling May be the masala This has a tangy taste which is good but not as good as the red masala I had requested the to make it spicy n it wasnt Overall it was an average fare n not much to complain about Like I said earlier this could have been lot better Might order other rolls in the future

Food I ordered

Kadhai paneer It was good l the paneer was tender and nice gravy you can have it with rice as well indian breads

Dal makhani I love it having with rice specially It was perfect

Paneer makhani I would highly recommend this it had good texture and thick gravy The taste was also very perfect must try

Fusion box paneer masala fusion box it ia quite fulfilling and satiating Do try this out

Veggie delight sandwich box8 sandwiches are really good too their moist bread and inside fillings was very yummy  fresh

Enjoyed the food"
2714,BOX8- Desi Meals,1,"Very bad service as there is no response to order placed and also they take more than 90 mins to deliver sorry not a good experience

2718,Roll Over,4,This place is the best for ice cream lovers We ordered banana caramel and blueberry ice cream rolls They provided the ice cream rolls with wafers The ice cream was so pleasing but the quantity needs to be improved You can try out the ice cream rolls once I didnt find any difference between ice cream and ice cream rolls tho ambience is quite decent
2719,Roll Over,3,Just about average The beating of icecream into thin sheets and rolling them sounds exciting but does nothing to the taste It is just that  a rolled up ice cream Ordered lychee rush and nutty kulfi Liked lychee but I was given a shot glass filled with milk to go with the ice cream which is a total mismatch according to me Nutty Kulfi mentioned kesar kulfi chunks but I couldnt see any I really think with so many extraordinary ice cream parlours coming up in Bangalore everyday Roll Over needs to change its game to keep up

2722,Roll Over,3,Liked the concept of the way they make ice cream 3 stars as quantity is less for the price Place is not that big to fit in crowd Will definitely visit once again for the DBC icecream and Pan magic ice cream rolls which are quite famous 
2723,Roll Over,4,I tried their signature desert which is chocolate karma n it was really a chocolate karma just loved the taste of it One should really try this out it will leave a memory on your taste buds

2730,Imperial Restaurant,5,Well im surprised about all the negative reviews written about the restaurant As my experience with restaurant was very different The delay in delivery may be there various reason cant blame restaurant for that Coming to food had ordered biriyani rice Quantityquality and taste was really gud Would definitely order again here
2731,Lassi Shop,3,Lassis are something that are not made everywhere might be better than other outlets but not the same as the Lassi we get in iconic outlets its just one of the outlet of a big chain
2732,Lassi Shop,2,"I ordered for a Nutella Brownie Icecream and was really disappointed 

The Brownie that they gave was a normal plum cake with the resin and all like srsly 

And the Nutella was concentrated to one side which made it really sweet at that side

And the Icecream was as much a teaspoon

All of which became a huge mess

2925,Patio 805,3,"A vegetarian Vietnamese place tucked away in 4th block This is run by the same owners of Hanoi in Koramangala however the restaurants are miles apart in terms of food While the ambience is top class and youll always find this place overcrowded the food could be better
What we ordered today   Half moon dumplings  the outer layer was too thick and the stuffing lacked salt However the dipping sauce was awesome  Bun Nuoc  Had good flavour  like manchow soup but the soup itself is too much for the amount of veggies and vermicelli  Vegetable fried rice  as good as normal steamed rice  Veggies in soy basil sauce  average Must note the ratio of gravy to rice is very less
Tip  ask for their chilli sauce to add to the dishes to bring back the flavour"
2926,Patio 805,3,"My new favourite Asian cuisine restaurant in Jayanagar Perfect menu
But one con  pricey
I have thoroughly enjoyed the virgin pina colada glass noodles fried rice baby corn manchurian here Also the simple yet classy ambiance

Pad Thai noodles turned out to be average would be good to have more vegetables

2951,Patio 805,4,"If you are looking for a good Asian Restaurant you are looking at one interesting place in Jayanagar

We tried their Vegetable fritters on sugarcane sticks It was delicious I would say and would definitely recommend The sauce that is given along with it is equally tasty For the main course we had the stir fried glass noodles where the noodles were made out of Tapioca which was good but could have had more flavor to it

Their ambiance is simple and very elegant A very nice place to take your family along

Their service is pretty good and they explain their dishes very well It could be more affordable"
2952,Patio 805,3,"Ambience is simple and yet so elegant The manager who greets and takes orders is fantastic I was delighted to see so much variety on an Asian menu for vegetarians We didnt want to experiment and went ahead and ordered whatever was suggested by the manager

We had the rice paper rolls and it was okay Extremely bland but the different textures and colours involved made it interesting We then got the Vietnamese coconut rice and Vietnamese curry Sticky fried rice of sorts was quiet good but the flavour of the curry was excellent Good option for vegetarians craving for some Asian food on the vicinity

The only downfall here is the service charge of 10 they levy and except for the manager all other service staff are amateur and need a lot of training"

We ordered
Peri Peri Fries  crispy and tasty
American Green Special pizza  could have added more vegetables
Grill paneer with lettuce sandwich was very tasty
Apple beetroot carrot juice  very healthy drink
Mint watermelon equally good

Their healthy drinks are the best else its like any other place I feel its slightly on higher side 900rs for 2 ppl is expensive"
3196,Bhattara Bhojana,1,I packed a full meal and in the meal we received the rice and sambar was good the tambuli was not good It tasted like vomit The beans palya was spoilt I called the restaurant and told them the problem They said that they did quality check before I ordered That time everything was good So in just five minutes of time that I ordered and took it home it spoiled I will never order from that place again
3197,Tandoori Knight,3,Its a small place better to take parcel as the place seems unhygienic and is pretty cramped up food is quite ok and filling and cheap too
3198,Tandoori Knight,2,Well nothing special to say about this place Pretty cramped up for space not so appealing Just okay okay for a quick bite Had the chicken Biriyani grilled chicken combo roti and egg burji and a half grill chicken Have to say that the grilled chicken was the only thing that seemed a bit good for me Was disappointed The other turn off is that smoke keeps filling up due to the tandoor and constant grilling
3199,Tandoori Knight,3,"I ordered quarter of each tandoori grill and tandoori  grilled never tried so wanted to try it
Delivery took nearly one and half hour Then there was only one kind of chicken which was looking like tandoori and grill both It had red color of tandoori and retained skin of the chicken as we usually see in grill Taste was not great Was not bad either never got to try their tandoori and grill as of individually Instead got their fusion of both
I will never order from there again till i have any other option They cant get the orders straight"

Guntur chicken was average garlic chicken was amazing though"
3207,Grazers,3,Had been to this place with family Its very to locate this place The food is average One major drawback which i noticed is that in the first floor the windows are open and not covered with any mesh if there is no wind then mosquito bite is guranteed I request the management to cover it with mesh if possible

Known for its breakfast and Italian food I thought of giving this place a shot
I have previously ordered multiple breakfast item via other services and they havent disappointed
However today was a bit different
We ordered fish fingers which in my opinion was bland It was just crispy on the out and soft but tasteless inside
Their chicken sausage was decent no wow factor
Ordered a single drink apple crancider which was a combination of cranberry and apple cider vinegar this was decent as well but had a slight harsh sensation in the throat due to the apple cider vinegar
So overall not a great experience but would like to try it out again to see how their pastas and pizza taste"

The Hot Dog had big chunks of Cottage Cheese tossed with barbeque sauce and fried onions It was served with hot crisp french fries and a unique delicious chutney  Coriander flavored Mayonnaise 

We wanted to try a cheesy pizza and ordered the famous Margarita Cheesy delicious topping on a thin crust pizza base made it all worthwhile There was a slight hint of spiciness in the cheese topping and we loved it

Momos were 10 pcs packaging was ok Sauce was different then what we usually get at other outlet but it was ok Momos were also nice

Sandwich was not good as it was grilled in oil or the stuffing was made in it and we feel its a cheap oil as we dont get such flavour and smell in any other sandwich we had till date Due to this it didnt taste good Filling was kind of ok there was no filling on the edges Packing was nice it was wraped in wraping paper inside a big box

Smoked burger was also ok there was negligent vegetables present Only 1 pc of cucumber there was no tomato or lettuce Also I mentioned no onions in special instructions but still there was onion
There was smell in burger as well Patty was fried in same oil

Tried the nutella brownie and red velvet sundaes In both ingredient components were put together via the popular stone and metal scraper Loved the nutella sundae as the taste was fantastic

Also sampled the dutch truffle milkshake Its a cake shake which means they incorporate a cake into their shake giving it an essentially cakey thick consistency Great for chocolate lovers its flavour is intensely chocolate and not overpowered by sweetness

In all good dessert spot Loved that the shakes came in glass bottles Hopefully they can reduce their plastic footprint by replacing their plastic straws with a more environmentally friendly substitute"

First impressions

Its next to a Dominos outlet and there were very few people but there were many people working in the kitchen but the ambience was quite peaceful

Service

It is a self serviced outlet and the staff were busy for most of the time we were there So was the managerowner who was there next to the staff doing what the staff did too

Food

We ordered Mandakki Oggarne Paddu Talipattu and Mirchi Bajji Apart from the Mandakki all the other items were amazing and ofcourse its not a fast food joint so they took their time to make it in the best way they could

PS  Talipattu is a must try


Over all Id say its a 45 only for their sheer lack of understanding of customer service Hope they are most receptive to the walkin customers"

Service  Some dishes are preprepared and they take their own sweet time to prepare the other dishes

Price  The prices are on the higher side when compared to the quantity taste and prices of the other restaurants offering North Karnataka cuisine

Taste  We tried the following items

Mandaakki oggarane  Was bland Didnt like it

Mirchi bajji  Was served hot yet wasnt great

Millet taalipattu  Best among the dishes tried here Really healthy and has a unique taste that I havent got to taste elsewhere

Girmit  Was too spicy to finish

Shenga holige  Good

Jowar roti with curry  Tasty but isnt worth the price

 If at all I revisit this place I would like to try millet bisibelebath"
3338,Gama Gama,2,"Unfortunately this hotel wont survive long

1 Self Service and highly priced
2 Absolute mess in the weekend
3 Mismanagement of orders

6 170 rupees charged for limited 2 rottis
7 There is no follow up service for people who need dishes and sambhars during the dinnerlunch

I would not recommend this restuarant for a peaceful meal"

1 Jolad RottiJawar rotti basic nothing special with it Brinjal Palya was tasty 355

3340,Gama Gama,4,A simple clean and hygienic self service restaurant serving North Karnataka dishes There are only about 8 to 10 tables and thus be prepared to wait during peak hours Enjoyed Girmit Holige Sabudhana Vada among other dishes
3341,The Vintage Cafe,2,This is a tiny caf located just opposite Kathriguppe Water Tank The interiors are quite nice and they serve a mix of Indian and American snacks The food isnt too good neither are the beverages Ive tried the Strawberry Milk Shake as well as Iced Tea and they have been nothing but flavored sugar syrups mixed with milkwater My pick of beverages here is the Chikmagalur Filter Coffee which is priced at 15 This caf is not really vintage but not terrible either
3342,The Vintage Cafe,1,Worst place not at al worth for money dont ever visit for 140rs u get a small pizza which is totally yuk and service is also too poor waste of money and time dont visit
3343,The Vintage Cafe,2,"A really tiny place and nothing vintage about it The food has hardly any quantity when it came to the veg cheese corn sandwich There were literally just 5 french fries with the paneer burger Ordered a pizza which was not good It felt like eating just cheese and no hardly any vegetables in it Not great service as well They dont have chilli flakes and oregano
K Thats all"
3344,The Vintage Cafe,3,Very cuteee placesuchha kutty place but very decorative peaceful toou can pay n play ludo n all there is a book ssection n no good books so they can improve on that coffee is good but sandwich was bad cheese was no baked can improve on food
3345,Pizza Hut,5,Great delivery amazing pizzas Italiano was really good and so was exotica Everything seemed fresh and adequate cheese Also the volcano cakes were yummy as well Crust was thick and soft Will order again soon
3346,Pizza Hut,5,"Okay to be clear I am not a big fan of pizza hut and some branches like Jayanagar are probably the worst I have been to but the Banashankari branch has some lip smacking offerings coupled with great service whenever I have been there

The pizzas are fresh straight out of the oven and taste perfect The only think pizza hut cant recreate is the cheese burst pizza of dominos Any version of their cheese pizza doesnt give you the cheesy satisfaction

Other than thatkeep up the good work pizza hut Banashankari"
3347,Mangalore Pearl,4,Nice place of course parking is an issue cant help but I would recommend this place for seafood and also vegetarians can accompany nice ambiance no fish smell around good veg options family place we ordered spl fish thali fish ghee roast fish tawa fry neer dosa mushroom ghee roast etc I recommend thali it is complete meal also ghee roast is a must
3348,Asha Sweets Centre,5,Wonderful lip smacking snack items Asha sweets centre is bang on Gandhi bazaar road and has a good variety of sweets savouries snacks We went for the samosa and kachori and I must say they are really delicious and worth it The size of the two were a bit on the smaller side but nevertheless good Looking forward to revisit
3349,Asha Sweets Centre,1,Worst place  I bot 3 chiroti and asked him to pack 3 Jodhpur ki ladoo with it He package Moti chur ji ladoooo  How can we eat chiroti with Jodhpur ki ladooo This is the worst place ever  I purchased this for my parents and travelling almost across the City n see this Worst place ever Very very unhappy
3350,Asha Sweets Centre,4,"Good sweet
Sweet are fresh
Value for money
Nice ambiance
Ordered rasmalai sweet and kulfi it was very nice and samosa kachori are also goodWe will visit once again"
3351,Asha Sweets Centre,3,"I was here for a quick grab Asha sweets extension is a dharshini outlet I had rawa idli and curd Vada Rawa idli was dry and chutney was not that great Sagu was good Curd Vada was the worst I ever had
I would not recommend this restaurant"
3352,Asha Sweets Centre,3,"Seems like a good place to eat North Indian food It is a sweet shop sadly couldnt get a chance to try out their sweets Overall its an OK placeDI
Best Regards

3353,Asha Sweets Centre,1,I had been here yesterday and parceled Basundi two cups with some cake and mixture While the other things were very good in quality unfortunately Basundi had gone bad The sales person had parceled the spoilt sweet I called up the store to complain and the cashier spoke to me and was not ready to accept that the sweet might have gone bad He was a bit rude answering my questions I had called up just to inform so that other customers dont get cheated Maybe the store should not offer such delicacy as parcel in the future My experience in this particular instance was not good
3354,Asha Sweets Centre,3.5,A variety of sweets available here is really rich the cost is little on the higher side but the quality of the product is really worth mentioning Been to its 23 outlets quality is equal across all stores Worth a try 
3355,Asha Sweets Centre,3.5,"One of the best sweet shop franchiseloads of varieties with fresh stock round the clockyummy tasty sweets and snackshad brought sweetsmoti chur laddu for my birthday to my officethe sweets were so fresh that we tried to pick them up from the boxthey dispersedthey were out of stock instantlyeveryone just loved themit compliments galore

3356,Asha Sweets Centre,4,The sweets and chaat is really good here Must try for badam milk lovers  The quality of all the dishes is up to the mark  Its right next to the mysore mylari hotel The dahi puri here is scrumptious  Overall a very good sweet and chaat centre to Vista while on the dvg road or in basvangudi 
3357,Asha Sweets Centre,3.5,"Asha Sweets is one of the popular sweet shop chains in Bangalore It started in Malleshwaram and it is famous for some of the Signature sweets I visited multiple times for their Cold Badam Milk it truly refreshes especially during summer Folks are friendly and attentive I will recommend this place

bangaloreepicurecom"
3358,Asha Sweets Centre,3.5,This is the branch of the legendary sweet meats store originally from Malleswaram I have been visiting this place since years now to have their badam milk on a regular basis nowMore details later on
3359,Twiststick House,5,"Its the perfect place in Basvangudi for short eats
They have Chinese Chaats Momos Potato on Stick Pizza Pastaetc
We end up here quite often
Our favorites are Pasta yummiest  Cheese Garlic Bread Paneer 65
The prices are so Pocket Friendly and total value for money
Theres just road side seating which adds to the whole experience
I guarantee ull leave d place with a happy foodie smile"
3360,Twiststick House,3,"This is a place just near the National College
Peri Peri Twisticks  Jain Twisticks is what I could have It was spicy and I could not have moreI think this place can be explored more Try visiting"
3361,Twiststick House,3,"Ordered from here for the first time This place is quite close to my house but was in no mood to go out so ordered through zomato only Got the delivery in time and it was hot also Had ordered mushroom pepper fries with mayonnaise mixed sauce pasta and tava pallav
Mushroom pepper was too crispy could not even make out whether it was mushroom or baby corn or potato Fries was decent pasta was good and tava pallav was average
Would like to visit the place and try there once as the ones we ordered was average"
3362,Twiststick House,4,"This is one of the lovely place to have good Chinese Not only chinese but others dishes are quite tasty I recommend you to try triple schezwan fried rice and cheese garlic bread Both taste amazing One of the famous dish of this place is their twiststicks Try any dish in here youll not be disappointed Its pocket friendly as well so if you are in money crunch no problem you can visit this place
I would rate this place 455
I just wish Zomato gets the old rating system back "
3363,Cool Corner,4,This place has really good masala dosa it is known for it Ive been here a lot of times especially to have their specials on various days Everyday they have a special rice item which again is a delight
3364,Cool Corner,4,"Looking for a quick and tasty bite then this is the place to go A hygienic self serving restaurant which is open throughout the day and serving awesome dosas sandwiches Icecreams and chaats

For breakfast they have sandwiches dosas n akki rotti too Juices are available always too

They have a huge variety of dosas masala set onion capsicum veg n rawa dosa

Masala dosa rava dosa pongal butterscotch milkshake butter fruit juice are few of my favorites here

Service is pretty fast but you ll have to wait a bit during peak hours"
3365,Cool Corner,5,"One of the best breakfast places
We just love their masala dosa and filter coffee
The dosa is served with two types of chutney which is very flavourful
The rice bath is the best when they serve pulao
I would recommend the akki rotti if you are health conscious
Their set dosa and onion dosa is also really good
Best filter coffee and their juices and sandwiches are also very good"
3366,Cool Corner,4,Went here for dinner and since I wanted to have something light ended up having Ragi Dosa Wanted to experiment a bit since this was my first time visting this hotel and also trying Ragi Dosa was in iteself was an experience for me Well must say I wasnt disappointed It was very good and the chutney thats given along with it compliments the taste It costs 45 which I think is priced on the higher side but then this not being a regular fare I felt it was ok You get 2 Ragi Dosas in a plate and its quite filling I again visited the next morning and needless to say I had the same dosa and it was good Good one guys
3367,Pizza Mane,5,This is just a minute away from my place  So glad to have a veg place for pizzas  sandwiches and burgers the hosts are so friendly  the pizzas are prep fresh  straight from the oven I had their pizza mane spl pizza with cucumber  capsicum onion  tomato cheese paneer Tasted brilliant and flavourful  Pic uploaded in images section they have small and medium base pizzas too Shall visit for more pizzas   Good going guys
3368,Dal Tadkaa,5,"I have never written any review on zomato but seeing such a good restaurant being rated so low made me took up the pen
Dal tadka serves really good homely north Indian food I come here every weekend for buffet lunch and love the taste
Guys dont go by the rating 29  Go there to experience authentic Rajasthani cuisine  I bet you wont be dissapointed
I found them even better than RAJDHANI at half the price
Try their buffet its really good"
3369,Dal Tadkaa,5,So sweet of oll item
3370,Dal Tadkaa,2,Visited this place long back dal bati was okay only choorma was good They serve jaljeera which is a tactic so that you eat moreNot so great place compared to other north indian restaurants
3371,Dal Tadkaa,5,food was very good
3372,Dal Tadkaa,3,"We surely get a proper Rajasthani feel here
Went today and tried the buffet They can do a lot better at the food and varieties available in buffet there because they cost much for food that they give but food is not upto that mark
Staff is fine and cooperative"
3373,Dal Tadkaa,1,worst items  Dont order anything here compare to this foot bath food is 200 best they will miss some items intentionally and no proper response we ordered home delivery they packed like beggar parcels  rating also 100 but no option so i rated 1        WORST FOOD and WORST service
3374,Dal Tadkaa,5,Really amazing 
3375,Dal Tadkaa,5,superb
3376,Dal Tadkaa,2,roti tikki has become hard so it was difficult to eat
3377,Dal Tadkaa,1,When I opted for buffet they said there is no time limit but after half an hour they closed the buffet even the food was not upto mark they made us wait for 10 min for starters and curd and raita was spoilt when I complained about it the manager didnt even respond properly Worst experiencenot worth I dont recommend it
3378,Dal Tadkaa,5,superb taste
3379,Dal Tadkaa,5,"It is one of the best restaurant The food in Dal tadkaa is best Rajasthani food The place is also is creatively decorated Coming to the food I love dal tadkaa stuff kulcha dalbati churma paneer butter masala garlic naan dal makhni kulfi moong ka halwa and many starters
I very frequently visit this place with my family and friends both I sometimes even order the food online the delivery of food is quite fast"
3380,Dal Tadkaa,4,"First of all I dont know why there are so many bad reviews of this great place Maybe its due to different circumstances
Anyways My family and I had gone there for dinner We went with the buffet choice The food was great The number of items was not too much or too less It was worth it Service was good and the ambiance OK

Overall experience was awesome Not the ultimate best but not 1 star worth either"
3381,Dal Tadkaa,1,"We visited this restaurant on sunday seeing that it serves special thali 347 RS including GST Its worth only 200 RS Food quality is ok ok Ambiance is really bad Service staff are worse When we took second plate they told we are suppose to finish lunch using only one plate Pathetic

After lunch if you visit washroom there is all possibility that you may vomit No maintenance at all

Simply waste of money Really not recommended for that price"
3382,Dal Tadkaa,1,I strongly recommend u to not even think of visiting here instead of having food i am reviewing it u could imagine how bad the food might be Not at all worth it
3383,Dal Tadkaa,1,Sad restaurant bad ambience and food Sweet corn soup was made from Chings readymade powder Roti was rock hard and veg biriyani tasted like tomato rice Period

3461,Dal Tadkaa,3.5,"If you want to enjoy bland food with no noise around then Dal Tadkaa is the place Authentic Rajasthani fare with a wide variety of food Sarson ka saag seasonal all types of rotis and mithai are must try A place worth visiting for those looking for a change

3462,Dal Tadkaa,3,"We visited Dal Tadka on a weekday The overall experience of dining at Dal Tadka is average to above average Considering that the price for the buffet is reasonable your expectations too are toned down The food does taste good and is also helped with courteous service The lack of too many dishes also lets you pick what you want to eat and have your fill Malpua is made too thick and thus not crispy Ironically the dal tadka and ghee rice are not too tasty But the overall experience is pleasant 
Good place to dine if you are in Banashankari area"
3463,Dal Tadkaa,1,I had heard a lot about this restaurant hence I went to try it outI was disappointed The pulkas were dry the sabzi tastelessthe tikki undercooked and the veg pulav didnt have a balance of masalasThe ambiance of the restaurant was good but whats a restaurant worth without good food We decided never to visit again
3464,Dal Tadkaa,1.5,Ordered home delivery The food was delivered on time and delivery guy was courteous But the food was equally bad Palak panner had no taste and panner was not at all fresh Veg pulao was also very bad had no taste or spice I dont think i would like to order again unless i see reviews of improvement
3465,Dal Tadkaa,3,"Now its not very fair to review this restaurant now as its been a very long time the last time I was there
But I do remember it so here it goes
It was on a weekend for a buffet lunch
Variety is normal like everywhere else but the service was quite good
There wasnt much in terms of desserts but hey for that price we didnt expect much as well
A place that you can skip without worrying of missing something"
3466,Dal Tadkaa,1.5,ordered paneer butter masala and rotis and naans for home delivery  the breads were well packed but the gravy was hugely disappointing  i had stomach uneasiness for hours after eating the food meaning its old or rotten food  totally unhealthy and not worth it if they cant make a simple gravy  i can only imagine how the remaining items are

Coming to the a la carte their hara bara kababs are really good Among the side dishes Dum Aloo Banarasi would be the pick The Indian breads are standard fare but the quantity is too little for that price

3557,Dal Tadkaa,3,The decor is good but its fully closed After some time i felt suffocation Food is not that good and its too overpriced overall experience was below average I would prefer Rajdhani Restaurant over this place
3558,Dal Tadkaa,3.5,I love the colours at this place and I love Rajasthani food So loved the ambience instantly As one of the first few restaurants in the area we would go often seats were not comfortable so we would order home or take away Buffet is very good here
3559,Dal Tadkaa,4,"The hotel is good No problem
With the food The hotel is Rajasthan style And I guess its quiet overpriced The buffet is also good Service is just fine  Overall you can have a good evening there"
3560,Dal Tadkaa,3,I visited this Rajasthani Veg restaurant located near Banashankari Katriguppe Main Road Buffet is the best choice as it is very affordable and has a lot of options The ambience gives the Rajasthani feel the moment you enter It welcomes you with JalJeera  has starters salad and curries that you can enjoy Soup was not so good Then you have plain rice rasam coloured rice as well Then you are introduced to some 23 Rajasthani sweets which are nice Then you have ice cream to end with The best part in the desert section is Mango and Peach Kulfi You have to order them separately since they are not part of the buffet This place can be visited during family events since the ambience suits well
3561,Dal Tadkaa,3,I was so looking forward to going to this place which boasted Rajasthani cuisine I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and the buffet they had running In fact I loved my first experience gol gappa night was awesome But then every other ala carte item we ordered seemed to have raw spices Im no expert cook but the masala wasnt roasted Which made it unpleasant and spicy Ive also seen the decline in the crowd going here
3562,Dal Tadkaa,3,For good budget veg food and of course a restro setting dal tadkaa is an easy pick in kathriguppe Just slight disappointment on the taste part but good enough to wipe your hunger Buffet  240 per person is worth a try only ever try a jaljeera drink here

The meal was delivered to me in a nice packaging within 40 minutes of ordering It had 2 small pieces of veg momos I could feel that was stuffed with cabbage a manchurian I couldnt recognise which one that was I think it was a mix veg thingy
The gravy they gave with the rice lookedtasted like how it would if a dal makhani is mixed with Szechuan sauce but surprisingly tasted ok
In the box there was some veg Hakka noodles along with veg fried rice which were ok The fried rice was dry as it could ever be though
The meal was VFM

Note to the restaurant Please look into special cooking instructions I had asked the dishes to be made spicy and it was conveniently ignored 1 for that

Would I try food from here again probably yes to give them another chance and see how their a la carte tastes like"

The packing was good and delivery was earlier as well Pasta was yummm n hot Coming to the combo noodles and momos was good Paneer fried rice was bland and paneer manchurian had become hard

Quantity was good enough for the price Its pocket friendly  we can give it a try I loved the pasta properly cooked n the sauce was also yummm"
3660,Mystique Palate,4,"I have only tried their Chicken Manchurian and it was tasty
From the beverage section I tried blue lime which was refreshing
Will definitely visit again"
3661,Mystique Palate,5,After going thru the reviews decided to head out to this place for dinner Tucked away in one of the bylanes of 4th Blk Jayanagar Must say I was quite impressed with what I saw Small little place and yet manages to attract the crowd First things first  I Opted to go for take away and ordered Schezwan Momos Paneer Thupka and Paneer Fried rice As far as the staff is concerned they are courteous polite and everything that you would want to see in em Got the stuff home and started digging to satiate my hunger Momos were awesome and have no complaints with it Paneer thupka is a flat noodle soup with a lot of veggies That was filling Tried their Paneer fried rice and must say it was nice I had requested them to make it with less oil and boy they were quite serious about it They made it with less oil just like the way I like it Awesome taste and surely a must visit again Besides its pocketfriendly too  Glad I ended up here
3662,Thamboola,4,"This place is very close to my house Went here for lunch with my family

This place is small but clean and appealing It stands out during the night with all the lights lit up It looks fabulous

Service is good Staff is busy and occupied but they do suggest whats good and how much is sufficient

Food is very good This place is a must for vegetarians if they dont mind shelling some extra bucks Everything we ordered was delicious Baby corn tandoori item and the veg kheema gravy were the best in the lot I still remember the taste
They do have buffet I always like a la carte as the food is our choice and not from restaurant

A thumbs up from me

PS  the lift does not work"

Food was very much spicy than expectedTomato soup didnt had much salt in it which made us to crave for that at the beginning itself

We had ordered paneer butter masala and Bhindi do pyaza for the main course A bunch of butter naanslacha paratha and butter kulcha
The naan is pretty big compared to other restaurants so be careful if you are ordering more
Both the currys were excellent and the naan was soft and smooth
But the tables and glasses are dirty They have a mat on their table which is filled with dirt and hasnt been cleaned for years The glasses have stains on them too
Overall the food prices r lesser when compared to other restaurants offering the same quality food
They have a buffet too

3668,Thamboola,3,"The ambiance as visible from the road below is the reason why I wanted to try this place Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch
There was a buffet on offer for 299taxes which I choose to not take and instead went for a la carte
Here are the details on the order and how they stacked up
Paneer Tikka Soft an flavourful 810
Cashew and Dhaniya Pulao Very buttery with loads of cashews 710
Veg Jhalfrazy A regular tomato based mixed veg gravy 610

Disappointing that on a Saturday afternoon they did not have most of the option for deserts The only one available was gulab jamun which I choose to skip
Overall a decent experience"

3672,Thamboola,5,"A great place for dineinThe ambience is just perfect with yellow lights and red glassesThe staff are very courteous and promptWe went there for dinner on a Monday night and still the place gradually filled up in no time
For starters we tried the spring rolls which was just mouthwatering and too yummy
Nextfor main coursewe ordered veg kolapuri and butter naanThe naan had generous amount of butter but the show stealer was veg kolapuri
 It was simply outstanding and really made our dayLooking forward to many more visits to try out their curries"
3673,Thamboola,4,"Namaste 
I recently visited thamboola in banashankari  The place is small  cosy and has a very nice ambiance  The service was also good 
The food here is mostly north Indian and Chinese

So for the appetizers
We took tandoori babycorn and tandoori aloo and Gobi  Both the dishes had the same marination and tasted good served with green Chutney and salad
For the main course
We took american corn noodles and veg biryani  The biryani tasted good which was served with raita but the American noodles was not that great  It dint have the wow factor  Also the forks were not clean 

Overall the place serves some good food  A pocket friendly place

3675,Thamboola,1,"Very bad experience staff are very rude and not friendly
We very not even given a chance to see the menu the manager was not interested
As we were in a hurry we told we Ill have half portion and the the other half take away or parcel for which he denied and said we Do not a have half and half parcel policy so when asked what are you going to do with the leftover he said we put it to the trash
Which was the disappointment so we decided not to eat and walked out"
3676,Castle Rock,4,"Castle Rock have a nice theme its ambience is of cave and garden with bamboo sticks Awesome place to take some cool pics
The price is competitively cheap when compared to other restaurants Total worth the price The quality of food and quantity is also good Best place to hangout with friends in private cave table
We had ordered fish fingers dragon chicken chicken drum sticks Biryani prawn Manchurian
Service should have improved Other than that everything is good

They have like cool hand wash area where the water flows from rocks"
3677,Vietnamese Kitchen,3,"Avg ambience  avg food  good service

Frankly most of the food lacked the flavour punch and tasted bland

Had the raw papaya salad the papaya was very coarse and unevenly cut The beans that were added were very hard and chewy The sauce was good but lacked the punch

Same with the gobi butter garlic fry Felt like gobi manchurian thats been toned down a notch

The pho is very filling and can be shared by two to three folks

The only good part the portion sizes are really big and hearty"
3678,Vietnamese Kitchen,4,"Truely good food Authenticnice and flavoursome was my experience 2 times I visited both the times food was really yummy as well as their hospitality was great Prompt service and caring attitude of the staffs what make you feel truely great I ordered burnt garlic rice chicken red and green chicken glass noodles soup and hot garlic fish dry apart from the fish dish I liked most of the dishes Taste and Quantity in both these parameters they scored very nicely
Visit surely "
3679,Vietnamese Kitchen,4,Good place for South East Asian food near my house Simple menu Tasty food Service is not too quick not too slow Can visit when youre craving for noodles or fried rice
3680,Vietnamese Kitchen,2,"Easy to spot cornered and naturally brightly lit place
The ambience is nice with a wide spread of tables service is quick and the waiters are polite

Food is a let down Not really Vietnamese
Lemon coriander soup Papaya Salad was just edible
Molten chocolate cake had nothing molten about it
Simple place nothing fancy
Not sure would go back Place ha a potential and can do better"
3681,Vietnamese Kitchen,3,"It is very close to the Deve Gowda petrol bunk  located on the first plot in the lane after Axis Bank
The decor is nice  the staffs are courteous
We ordered for Mekong Fried Rice mixed  Hot  Spicy Chicken on the advice of the staff serving us
The Hot  Spicy chicken was unlike anything oriental I had ever eaten  did more than justice to its name The fried rice was lumpy but didnt taste bad either"
3682,Vietnamese Kitchen,4,Really loved the glass noodles this is something I havent tried before Properly cooked but bit of oily this is the reason I cut one star rating for the review Vet Non veg fried rice was well cooked and mixed with Chicken tiny Prawns and and tasty and it was well worth the price
3683,Vietnamese Kitchen,3,A restaurant with basically nothing Vietnamese in it Its just another Chinese restaurant around the block The place was bustling with people around dinner time The food we ordered was good but again contrary to as expected nothing Vietnamese Portions were good and service was prompt Prices were also fair enough just about an average place

Food  we tried chicken hot and sour soup which was good
The green papaya salad with chicken that we tried was fantastic and tasted kinda sweet and a had pieces of pan friend chicken
Mushroom manchurian that we had was not thar great and was too soggy and salty
And finally the main course was viet kitchen fried rice which was not great though
There ambience is descent and they provide good service"
3687,Vietnamese Kitchen,4,"I visited this place with my friend for lunch last week Its very easy to spot It has a decent ambience
Food we ordered
veg dumpling the filling tasted good but the outer layer got hard very quickly and it became difficult to cut through

Chocolate Molten Lava cake with ice cream this was the BEST dish on their menu The cake itself was extremely side and bouncy It literally bounced It was the perfect sweet  not to sweet or bitter The ice cream that was served with it was good too The molten chocolate was simply delicious Its a MUST HAVE

Vietnamese sandwich called Bah M  this was my first time eating this surprising it was very yummy It had a great and unique flavor and bread itself was quite unique

Crispy chili basil Gobi this dish was like a regular Gobi Manchurian It didnt have any extraordinary taste infact it could have been better

Service decent service kind staff members a bit slow Overall good"
3688,Vietnamese Kitchen,1,"The place itself looks decent with courteous and smiling waiters But alas thats where it ends
I ordered for a Thai chilli basil fried rice and a babycorn in black pepper sauce to take away
The menu says the fried rice is spicy and I ask them to make it spicier with the babycorn in black pepper sauce to be a spicy gravy too What I got was a garlicky moosh for fried rice which even my 3 year old daughter was able to eat bland and the biggest surprise was that I was given dry vegetables and not the gravy
When I called back to complain the guy very politely told me that the kitchen was closed and apologised He also told me that I could actually have my fried rice without the gravy too   This is when I had to tell him that the fried rice was in edible and hence I was calling
Overall very disappointed"
3689,Vietnamese Kitchen,3,"It really sucks to give 3 star to Vietnamese kitchen but I was so disappointed after having such high expectations

To be clear service was good but the food was averageborderline mediocre They do not have shumai even though its listed in the menu and the momos had a chewy hard texture Pho taste was too bland The broth had no depth of texture or tatse more like some vegetable and chicken boiled in water with salt and pepper Lost interest and didnt order the main course

zomatogold helped Chicken Pho and Veg momos came to 490 and zomatogold reduced it down to 310 something

My mind is against visiting again even though my heart so wants to"
3690,Vietnamese Kitchen,4,Authentic Vietnamese food available here Perfect blend of flavour and spices in the food specially the Vietnam kitchen noodles and the chicken momos For the vegetarian lovers the mushroom and baby corn will just go quite well
3691,Vietnamese Kitchen,2,"Located by the main road this place is easy to spot because of their huge sign board

3694,Smacznego,5,Been here multiple times First visited a year back Their cheesy loaded nachos were really good Their waffles although takes a lot of time to make do taste quite yummy Even their white sauce pasta is nice And the prices are definitely worth the taste Service is pretty good too Love visiting this place

3697,Smacznego,4,"Yummy saucy fries Loved every bit of it  and worth the price  al the items on the menu were cheap and the quantity wasnt bad loved their mix of sauces

3698,Smacznego,4,Value for money everything they offer is amazing The fries are especially delicious and make for the perfect snack Been here a lot and tried almost everything they have to offer definitely worth it

3718,Paratha Merchant,4,From this place my experience is only through zomato online food order Only reason for repeat order of five times is their taste Very homely food preparation n taste Somehow everytime I end being hungry and never managed to take a picture of the for served Will surely do it on my next order Pulka dhal and aloo jeera is served for rs99 on zomato and it is really worth the money All the very best team keep it going

3725,Toscano,4,"Saturday Night Dinner
Baked Jalapeos  The pungency of the Jalapeos was remarkable just enough to tingle the senses and yet subtle
Toscana Signature Goat Cheese Salad  this is one phenomenal must try Salad Every element is perfect Be it the beets the apple the apricot of the greens
Shiraz Rose Wine  this wine was quite dry and the bouquet was great
Fettuccine with English Vegetables  the Vegetable were cooked to perfection yet the fettuccine was downright disappointment though the manager did come up and offer a replacement
Overall surely I would go back again Second visit in 3 days"
3726,Toscano,4,"Ten years old chain of restaurants and one of best among their cuisine I guess
Spread in ground and first floor with good seating capacity and great ambience friendly service and a vast menu

3728,Toscano,3,Average food Did not particularly enjoy the experience as the food was bland and average The pizzas are really good though The pasta and the risotto that I had was very flavourless
3729,Toscano,4,I really loved the ambience The hospitality was really nice Tried one of their creamy pasta loved the creaminess of the pasta though I wish the pasta should have been a bit more cooked Overall the place is really good
3730,Toscano,5,Never been disappointed with this place Be it hospitality or the food Its open all thru and so good food anytime  we went at 4 30pm for our lunch on a sunday and has a sumptuous meal their pizzas are thin crust and loaded with toppings My friend loved her chicken salad Tried the mulled wine speciality of Christmas season and was happy Slightly on the higher range on price but worth it
3731,Toscano,5,"This was my first visit to Toscano and it was an amazing experience
The service was top notch from the beginning to end

Tried the Chicken Barbeque Pizza and it was an absolute delight And the toppings are customizable
The ambience is amazing and the food was legit Italian

Just one request
You could really work on the playlist as the songs didnt really match up to the ambience and food

Great experience overall
Special thanks to Mr Biswas for great service"

The Restaurant is located in the main road near Jayanagar Shopping complex

Entire place is themed like a Central Jail
Jailers taking orders Prisoners serving food Tables inside prison cells etc etc

Each prison cell can accommodate only 4 people  so if you are going in a big group you will have to sit outside the prison cell

I am a pure Vegetarian so i can comment only on Veg Food
The Food was very good

The prices are little on the higher side
But if you want a different experience it should not be a matter

Totally worth a visit"
3761,Central Jail Restaurant,4,Visited the place with my family which is located in the prime location of Jayanagar 4th block As the name says the ambience is in the jail format with 45 cells and few regular tables but somewhere I felt ambience incomplete I would give 3 for ambience The main part is the tastecost and quantity Taste of the food makes us to visit again as well s the quality price is bit expensive side Staffs are friendly and into quick service Over all worth visiting keep up the good work
3762,Central Jail Restaurant,1,This review is for hospitality more than foodjust dropped in today with lot of anticipation as this was in my bucket list for long so I landed only to know that the place was closed as door was open I just went in to enquire if we can waite as there was 2 Minfor opening but bang come a person and way he shooed us out and banged door on our face and tone with which he said das minute Baad aavojust gave me n my friend truly central jail experience will think twice before I get booked or locked up in this place again 
3763,Central Jail Restaurant,3,"Themed restaurants have always been a great source of attraction and enjoyment the rate at which these restaurants have been coming up over the past year is astonishing Ive seen somewhere around five of them popping up ranging from cars trucks and caves This time what caught my fantasy was a restaurant themed as a prison 
Read full post on rajeevabasavarajuwordpresscom"
3764,Central Jail Restaurant,3,"As the name suggests interiors is based on Prison cell
Food is served in Al Plates as in Prison
Ordered Chicken Kshatriya in starters Its A Semi dry dish Leg pieces with dash of gravy Taste is okay but can be better
In the main course go for the Chicken Encounter which is quite different  very tasty Its Chicken cooked  wrapped in Omelette with rich tomato gravy With Tandoori Roti is a good combination
Ghee rice was well cooked with dry fruits in it Tasted good with the curries  tastes even more better when eaten by hand
Lime soda was also good with sweet  salt mixture balanced well
Staff are courteous  watch out for their attire which is quite different from the traditional bearers attire"
3765,Bella,4,This is a not much known place in jayanagar This has a good coastal menu in it I would say a good peaceful place with simple n cute ambience Looking at the seafood special menu I tried prawn sukks appam chicken pulimunchi need dosa and sannas which is nothing but the normal idli All tasted good and so was the service A family type restaurant and would like to visit again
3766,Bella,1,Horrible is not the word for service and food at this place This place isnt sweet as Bella but bitter like bevu They messed up the order food was tasteless we had to wait for over an hour just to get our food and drinks Lime juice tasted like plain water chicken ghee roast was pathetic and mutton biryani was uncooked and tasted horrible I cant understand how a restaurant can run with such bad food and service To top it all the food was highly priced and all we got was arrogant service Best is to avoid such a place
3767,Bella,2,"After seeing so much reviews on Zomato finally tried this hotel its not worth the hype
Ordered
prawns masala fry was good
Seer tawa fry  Chicken biryani was worst
Ragi Manni dessert was also very bad"
3768,Bella,5,"Bella is an honest celebration of Manglorean cuisine at its core
The decor and ambience is very inviting and homely The outdoor seating is beautiful
Coming to the food my favourites are neer dosaappam paneerchickenprawncrab ghee roast the pulimunchi the vegetable stew the mutton shorba ragi manni and the coconut payasam
And of course the seafood is mind blowing

The food is delicious and very well prepared
So happy that there is another amazing place in jayanagar to have a great lunchdinnerwith family especially"
3769,Bella,3,Bored up with usual pasta pizza and chicken wings Place here to let ya tongue taste new A family restaurant located in the prime area of Jayanagar with a feel of being home An authentic Mangalore styled food blended with Kerala touch is the major attractionChicken ghee roast pepper chicken egg pakoda and appam are the must haves fish fry is equally goodLittle pricy when compared to other restaurants round but isnt a authentic food always comes with a price tag 
3770,Bella,4,"Wanted to give 45

A deliteful  cuisine place right  the heart of 11main jayanagar
Tried egg and chicken ghee roast anjal masala fry chicken sukka egg appam appam  neer dosa

Ghee roast masala was excellent with the right hints of sweetness and sourness anjal masala fry could be a lil More better as masala tasted a little bland sukka was excellent and the spices really stood out

Loved the egg appam its was damn filling and tasted brilliant with sukka

Would love to come here soon and have more mangalore style dishes"
3771,Bella,4,Despite popular belief vegetarian food was just brilliant Paneer ghee roast babycorn chilli and the best of all the neer dosa A must visit 
3772,Vennela Andhra Meals,4,One more new authentic Andra resto in Jayanagar for foodies bucket list We planned to visit this place for dinner tonight Good place ambience quite decent service is quick and very attentive staff  we ordered chicken fry garlic naan butter roti paneer tikka masala and steam rice food was delicious and very spicy food authentic Andra spices and we enjoyed the food
3773,New Prashanth Hotel,2,Hotel is not maintained clean and ventilation is not properI liked kamakya outlet thought to try in jayanagar faced total disappointed with quality of food and servicewont suggest to go heretry other outlet bommasandrakamakya both are maintained well and service is also good
3774,New Prashanth Hotel,3,Nati oota which did not taste like there original prashanth at this outlet Ragi balls were very hard Okay kind off ambience and budget friendly
3775,New Prashanth Hotel,4,All time favorite combo Ragi balls and mutton chops and this place takes the cake for the best Ragi ball Soft and no rice mixed Try it the next time youre in Jayanagar
3776,The Grillo,3,"It was late afternoon We missed our lunch and hopped in to The Grillo at around 5 in the evening

The staffs were friendly but seemed inexperienced Since it was late a couple dishes we asked were not available But we managed to order Neerdose chicken Sukha and Sholay kebabs

Neerdose was decent and did tasted good with chicken Sukha Loved how Sholay kebabs were rolled inside a layer of eggs"
3777,The Grillo,4,"Good food
This is newly opened Restaurant in jayanagar 4th block opposite to Maiyyas restaurant
It has got normal ambience and the service was little slow inspite of less customers
Coming to the food I had chicken manchow soupcrispy chicken and mutton dum biriyani nati style
Mutton dum biriyani was more spicy
Quantity was good of all the items
Rates are affordable"
3778,Re Malnad Nati Style Hotel,5,Good and tasty Malnad style foodworth price againSpecial Malnad Kadubu is famous for all season Go and eat definetly you are loving this restorent with good atmosphere
3779,Re Malnad Nati Style Hotel,5,"Super taste and i love to eat Malnad Akki KadbuNeer dhosa with fish gravy and This is like fully home made taste

I love it Thank you"
3780,Re Malnad Nati Style Hotel,5,"Best place for Malnad ppl to have thier home food
And highly recommend place for foodies who want to try authentic Malenadu part of karnataka type of food"
3781,Karma Kaapi,4,"This place has personally become my favourite because of the service and the coffee they serve The cafe is a small place and they have handwritten menus
They have their own coffee brewery so the coffee is pretty great here and the barista serves the coffee with art performed
I wouldnt recommend the hot chocolate though but you can try out the coffee
Another personal favourite of this place is the KARMA FRIES 
Do check out this place and let me know about any other thing I could try out in here"
3782,Karma Kaapi,4,"Visited this place yesterday for a quick coffee break and I wasnt disappointed with the taste at all
Ambience is good but the service is too slow Also the price is on the higher side according to the quantity but yes the variety of coffee they have is mind blowing And they roast their own beans so 
Its a must visit
Surely gonna try other varieties next time"
3783,Karma Kaapi,5,I adore Karma Kaapi  its located in Jayanagar but slightly away from the hustle and bustle Formerly called Benki Kaapi the place is revamped and amazing The interiors are quirky and inviting Its a great place to catch up with people or simply nurse a well brewed beverage while working We ordered two cafe mochas and a corn bhel The coffee was out of this world but the bhel could have been better The prices are on the higher side but worth it I cant wait to try out more things from their insanely cute handmade menu Definitely going back very soon
3784,Karma Kaapi,4,"Indian grown delicious and flavourful coffee
A nice clean and friendly space
The staff is so friendly and super nice
They will help you choose a coffee and the menu is hand drawn 
Also three cheers for customising the cold coffee with soy milk for my lactose intolerant friend 

Will surely come back again"
3785,Karma Kaapi,5,Five stars for the utter professionalism Ambience cool innovative Coffee out of the world Madrasi pasta good They forgot to bring in the cafe Mocha on time so they didnt charge for it even on constant request to add the amount in the bill My husband became their fan for truly believing in the name Karma kaapi
3786,Karma Kaapi,5,Totally Loved the ambience made such good use of a small room and it looks absolutely amazing Red velvet latte was exclusively great service was great as well Its a must try place
3787,Karma Kaapi,4,"Cute and cozy place for some catch up with friends over a coffee Ambience is nice and looks brighter Loved their Menu Card which is hand written

Tried

1 Red Velvet Latte  Has the perfect amount of red velvet and the sweetness is perfect and presented beautiful and the color of the latte steals the heart

2 Salted Caramel Latte  Because like they said Salt is Life They give you extra caramel along which indeed is required Enjoyed every sip of latte with salt

3 Spicy Potato Wedges  I could eat this all day Perfectly done and the dip served along went well

Totally loved the place Will visit again to try more"
3788,Karma Kaapi,4,Whose not a coffee lover in todays world When u get all ur favorites in one place why go anywhere else This small warm welcoming cafe is a perfect heaven for those who love brewed coffee This cafe will brew your coffee in more than 20 ways from all across the world that will make you fall in love with coffee again and again I visited this cafe recently and tried cold brew Vietnamese mango coffee coffee bite coffee salted caramel latte and iced caramel latte The cold brew was cold and mild version of black coffee Its a perfect coffee cooler rare to find anywhere else Coffee bite and mangoes are one of most loved food items When get blend with your favorite coffee the result has to be grand No exaggeration but the Vietnamese mango coffee and coffee bite coffee is all one needs for a good day Salted caramel latte and iced caramel latte are equally worth sipping down Had a great experience Must must try for all out there and you will know there is more to coffee
3789,Karma Kaapi,3,Ambience is too good even the food tastes delicious  but the prices are way too high and quantity of food is too less for the price charged  and the service is tooooooooo slow  the price of potato pops are Rs  149 but the quantity of it is not more thn 7 to 8 potato pops  disappointed
3790,Karma Kaapi,5,"The brightly lit Karma Kaapi was a place Id passed by many times making a note to visit so when I finally did it was on a rainy Sunday evening A little space that blends form with function with a glass wall little wooden benches and yellow lighting its quite the perfect nook One sometimes forgets that visiting a cafe isnt just about the food and drinks but an experience  and Karma Kaapi reminds you of it

We had the charcoal latte the mocha and focaccia sandwich at this vegetarian joint The charcoal latte was unlike typical trendbased drinks in the sense that it not only looked Instagramworthy but was delicious to boot The mocha had latte art of a piglet  super cute The sandwich was made well and had super fresh produce such a welcome respite

Add to this their welltrained courteous staff who was able to recommend drinks we had a great experience here 1010 will visit again Best recommended for smaller groups or couples"
3791,Karma Kaapi,4,"Love going to coffee places and this time I tried something new I tried red velvet latte and caramel latte Redvelvet was something new for me You get that redvelvet taste when you take a sip Its better to have it when its hot If you let it cool down while chit chatting with your friends its gonna taste like plain milk I loved caramel latte Its just amazing Its one of my favourite latte I also tried spicy potato wedges It was crispy outside and soft inside I loved the dip
I love their simple ambience I love how creative they are when it comes to their interior the lights  table and benches Friendly staff and not very pricy"
3792,Karma Kaapi,4,"Its just awesome Located at the opposite of Slimsins restro cafe in Jaynagar 

Very small cafe with varieties of caffeine And some chats for the drink Best place for the couples 

Most attractive thing is food Menu designed by pencil writings And red and green kind of interior patterns Those are eye catching 

When it comes to food and drink we ordered one cold coffee And red valwet drinks with pototoe wedges 

Both food and drink are tasty and right quantity for the price we paid 

So overall 45 "

Also had thali here good phulka but the side dish quality can be slightly improved Though hot yummy parata guaranteed"
3812,Tiwari's,4,"Mouth drooling Parathas
Too many varieties on the menu which I havent tried completely but surely will do some day
Prices are not too much heavy on the pockets as well
The pickle and the Pudina chutney they serve along with the Parathas are delicious
The Lassi is also a must try as well"
3813,Tiwari's,1,Very disappointed with the taste and managing of order Ordered Pani Puri with additional instructions which wasnt taken care  Dahi kachori  kachori not fresh at all and it was very dry and all the masala was dried with no taste Same with dahi papdi chat Guys u need to improve ur standard 
3814,Tiwari's,5,Amazing parathas I always order online and lassi is one of the best love it but mostly there is no stock of it  it would be great if that could be made available mostly

3823,Tiwari's,3,Main plus point is hygiene Taste wise paratha and chats are tasty Slightly expensive No tables Or even slabs to keep plates So difficult to eat at times Slow service and cards not accepted Quantity is average compared to price

3848,Tiwari's,3,"Any day is good day with North Indian meals for me Especially Parathas
This place has a range of Parathas Chaats Pulka meals Laasi and Khowa Jamoon
Medicore crowd with decent food

We opted for
 Palak Paneer Paratha served with Curd Pickle and Green spicy chutney It was yum and spicyy
However I absolutely do not like the idea of adding onions in the Paratha mix so it was just fine as per my preference
 Khowa Jamoon wasnt willing to try it but on friends recommendation I did It was light and just fine

Service was quick however Im skeptical about hygiene Could spot some masala in my Khowa Jamoon bowl

Value for money 355"
3849,Tiwari's,4,Good Parantas hygienic and value for money u wanna grab a quick bite jus drop inno much space to sit and dine basically its a take away point
3850,Tiwari's,3.5,Very neat and well maintained place They will make the paratha right in front of you So its always fresh and not like they just heat the old ones and give you Since they make it fresh it will take time They have buy 1 get 1 Offer on mondays Other days I dont think its a value for money So on Mondays hey

3963,Cake Yard,2,"Cake yard attracts many people with its name 
This place is located near krishna rao park 
I was here with my family to have a nice pastry  
As we entered lot of pastries are displayed  variation of flavors colors and shapes 
and we ordered for creamy chocolate 
This chocolate cake was displayed beautifully and attracted me
but i dont understand the way it tasted for me
pastry was made with chocolate and groundnut  
Groundnut seriously  i didnt like 

Taste  2

3964,Cake Yard,3.5,This is one good option to buy pastries birthday cakes cookies naans puffs etc in this part of Basavanagudi The bakes are serves fresh The store is pretty clean  tidy too On weekends they offer discount on the cookies too The rates are pretty reasonable  the taste good Yes I will be back soon to try some other pastry or puff soon
3965,Cake Yard,3.5,"As my foodie friend Mahima Koteshwar rightly reviewed We had this cake for one of our friends birthday I was little hesitant in the beginning to try a new place for an occasion It turned out to be great Black Forest pastry was fresh yummy and bang on

Would love to be back here for more pastries

3966,Cake Yard,3.5,"Just happened to be a friends birthday and the others picked up a cake from here and I was quite skeptical about this place as its pretty new and I didnt know if the cake would turn out to be one of like the typical bakery cakes 

It was a blackforest cake  it looked very ordinary like a sweet chariot presentation it so happened that  which also was surprising  the cream was fluffy and the cake tasted good It wasnt anything extra ordinary but it was good A simple and a good cake

Since it was an emergency and the cake was bought at the very last minute  I cant complain much  It was fine and I wouldnt mind having these cakes again be it with or without occasion"
3967,Cake Yard,3,Our anyday choice for occasional cakes was Ammas pastries Since we wanted to try something new we opted to tryout this place This place is situated near Krishna Rao park on kanakapura road There werent much options to choose from We bought a Honey almond cake and some cookies The cake was too dry and average Cookies were just ok When compared to other similar places which serves pastries this place is quite pricey
3968,Cake Yard,3.5,The taste of the pastries Gateaux are good Not very pricy But a very bad thing about this place is that they dont accept cards So better carry cash along with you or there is an ATM opposite to it but crossing that on a busy weekend evening is also a tough task 
3969,Cake Yard,3,bought some assorted parties dint like any some how the quality of the pastry is not that great and we can get better ones elsewhere i do not think i will visit again This cake shop is very nearby to my house but ts a big let down
3970,Rosewood International Hotel - Bar & Restaurant,5,"Awesome food Great serviceFriendly staffsGood quality of food

3971,Rosewood International Hotel - Bar & Restaurant,5,"Newly Launched Bar  Restaurant Good Food quality Like to visit again Also like to suggest to others
Nice Ambiance and setting Also outdoor dining is available Did like the Chicken grill"
3972,Cake Art,2,Bad quality of puff and Bombay salt oil used for preparing mixture and other items are smelly may be there are no buyers for it Cakes samosa and jilebi are average
3973,Cake Art,2.5,This bakery has been here since a long time The taste is quite good They were having large number of customers but they lost more than half of their customers since they renovated the place i dont know the reasons
3974,Cake Art,3,"The Shop looks good from the outside
The cakes are nothing greatBut Pretty cheap
Sponge cakes are too soggyAlmost as if They were Just pulled out from Freezer after a few days  some water was splashed on them to keep them moist
The Pastries only Appear good"
3975,Cake Art,4,Their cakes are affordable and artistic It is a bakery given a facelift to pastry shop The pastries are good mousse are above average It is the normal savories baked biscuits and normal cakes which are still the USP
3976,Cake Art,4,Fine cakes with nicely stored enjoyed black forest and white forest some times samosa is also nice hereKurkure items like fried ground nuts and kodubale chakkali fine to enjoy
3977,Cake Art,3.5,"Cake Art is a Bakery where they serve some beautiful cakes  pastries at affordable prices in the locality I tried their Black Forest and Butter Scotch pastries and quite decent but not best They also have bakery products ones we get at Iyengars Bakery The Shop is well maintained with decent dcor and hygienic though During my last visit price of 1kg pastry was around 350 bucks which I feel affordable and value for money

I prefer this outlet for the traditional cream cakes we hardly see now days I like those cakes better than pastries Recommended place for bakery products

3979,Potato House,3,quantity was less according to the price
3980,Potato House,4,"Simple and damn tasty food is what describes them best
Potato house is a tiny place with limited seating located near Chikkalsandra post office
I have tried almost everything on their menu Must haves are Kachi Dabeli Vada Pav Sabu Vada Aloo sandwich

3984,Hotel Biriyani Counter,3,"Delivery by zomato on time
Response on call good
Food quality average biryani was poor
Packing average

3985,Matru Sagar,5,Good place with dinner with family decent option on Mysore road South Indian North Indian and Chinese foods also very tasty And Good responsible people
3986,Matru Sagar,5,The food was absolutely wonderful from preparation to presentation very pleasing We especially enjoyed the North Indian foods and Matru Sagar Special Ice cream Great value for the price We highly recommend it
3987,Matru Sagar,5,Thanks to Zomato Matru Sagar fast delivery  food tastes good I recommended guys they taken only few min to deliver I really appreciate it thank you soooooo much
3988,Matru Sagar,1,Staff doesnt have any sense at all They start abusing if you press them for getting something A place that should never be visited by a family at least Not possible to give minus rating otherwise 1 is also too much for this place
3989,Matru Sagar,1,"Though the food is okay in this place the customer experience you get from their staff is miserable to say the least  To get a simple order they made me wait for 1 hour and when i checked about my order instead of being apologetic  the stupid manager started throwing attitude and arguing with me with some lame excuses HORRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE I am for sure never going to visit this place again and will ensure that none of my family and friends visit this place  This is the second time that I have experienced such a thing from this place 
Though the hotel owner is a good person he needs to check the quality of staff members he has All the best"
3990,Matru Sagar,4.5,Our preferred place for quick food as its closer to our house Good food and picket friendlychats are just okthe service is good and no problem for parking as well
3991,Matru Sagar,3.5,"A pretty decent option in this part of the city for a quick breakfast or lunch before you head out elsewhere We had our breakfast there after a long tiring night journey Hunger was killing us thank goodness the waiter came up with our Puris vadas and coffees pretty quickly The first floor is more peaceful and suitable for families who prefer a little more comfort than what is being offered in the ground floor
Overall a pretty nice place for South Indian food in this area"
3992,Matru Sagar,5,Good food Good ambience Best in this part of town Worth for money and hoping to come back soon once again Good place to dinner with family
3993,Matru Sagar,3,Decent option on Mysore Roadambience service food all ok The masala papas here was yum with coconut shavings on top which adds to taste of onions tomatoes n coriander leaves
3994,Matru Sagar,4,"Decent food on mysore road South and North Indian meals are decent
Mushroom Manchurian was tasty
Mushroom fried rice and noodles are also tasty"
3995,Ugadi,5,I just love the biryani here and also kababs and tandoori Even they have best seafood here I will definitely recommend this if u are a seafood and chicken lover
3996,Ugadi,1,One of the worst services ever If the hotel management spends even 5  of their profits on hiring service staff they can improve the service by 1000 times strictly avoid After such an experience it doesnt matter how the food was it wasnt good anyways
3997,Ugadi,5,"The best Andhra style cuisine I have had in Bangalore definitely the best Andhra meals and briyani to go for Hoping to come everyday for my meal
good food great service"
3998,Ugadi,5,Awesome service and tasty food I would like to go there again and again the way they were attending us was great with this service they well reach heights
3999,Ugadi,4,Lot of reviews show it is not serving upto level food Maybe my day was one of the restaurants better ones  Suggested by a colleague To start Andhra chilli chicken One thing i need to say abt this dish If anyone is dammnn big fan of green chillies Please go for it For others its a big no no Chicken kebab biryani tasted nice The biryani rice was fine But the kebabs were amazing  Other items were descent enough as well
4000,Ugadi,1,Never visit this place Worst service food place They wont even serve water initially Only when u will ask for bill then only they will get water Biryani also is bad

4002,Ugadi,3.5,Lovely Andhra meals tried alot of places for andhra meals specially but this places had a variety of flavours Veg meals I ordered the ugadi special chicken it was lovely  The place has to work on the power supply cuz the AC werent working cuz of power cut This place has the taste of Andhra 
4003,Ugadi,1.5,Very average restaurant May be it was good when it started but no where its Food matches with Andhra Style  I tried chicken starters and tasted very bad and this is must avoid place 
4004,Ugadi,1,"Biggest NO
Ordered plain Veg Sweet corn soup but was served with a garnishing of Cockroach Brought the same to the attention of the manager Instead of taking it right away he called the person who served it Had to withstand it some more time Started walking out as soon as the dish was taken away Manager didnt even bother to apologize Went to the person sitting at the cash counter told him I got cockroach in veg soup He said OK Left the place disgusted"
4005,Ugadi,4,Good place to have food If you are north Indian go to this place will find paratha here just order chapati as they have different terminology
4006,Ugadi,4.5,Pure Andhra style In Telugu we call it as pandaga bhojanam I feel like having food at my home Found one of the best place Ambiance is good and service is amazing Will definitely visit soon
4007,Ugadi,1,Lets keep it short  I should have stepped back when I saw very less crowd sitting on hot sunny Saturday The worst biryani I had ever The disgusting andhra chilli chicken In short AVOID THIS PLACE
4008,Ugadi,3,Average biryani satisfying thali and good kheema balls Why am I reviewing a place where I had only few items Because this place served a pretty decent food but the pricing was a little too steep Would I go back Not really Would I suggest it to people Maybe just once Heavy on the pockets
4009,Ugadi,1.5,"Actually a big NO to this place Dont go to this place for food you will get disappointed only And according to people this place was used to be serve good food Now the reduced there quality very badly

Food ambience service
Dont be baffled by the same points listed but if youve been here youll know Theres something lacking in this restaurant foods delicious but far too spicy for a normal mans tummy to handle Ambience is peaceful and dim lit like any other resto but lil jam packed I was happy with the waiters service and how they recommend dishes but the time from the food ordered to arrival on my plate makes anyone go nuts with impatience I understand its Andhra style food but I really wish theyd cut down the spice level of their food so that everything else falls into place"
4077,Ugadi,3,An an alternative to the meghanas and nandhinis However the location is quite tricky The biriyanis will not let you down for sure As frequently mentioned the service has to improve 
4078,Ugadi,1,the worst experience i orderd first time thali it was ok but when i orderd second time i was cheated there were so many items was missinglike phulkasweetsand so many and apart from this 25 extra for deliveryvery expensivevery bad service
4079,Ugadi,3,I guess they have recently started this place as I was out of bangalore for a month was craving for andhra meals someone suggested me this place to try out order for a Thali food was ok though not 100 andhra style but with thali they gave us Phulka it was real phulka  service was dam slow they need to improve a lot on service

4091,Ugadi,3,The restaurant will give a treat to nonvegetarian tongues Being Andhra styled meals lack spice The ambience is average while people with asthma may die instantly because the place is tightly packed with no fresh air entering

4101,Ugadi,4,"Tasty authentic food

Had been here while searching for a good authentic place to eat Its relatively
I ordered the unlimited meals and boy they were so much on the platter almost 12 or 15 different dishes served in small cups n 3 different kinds of sweets
A must visit if you are in jayanagar

The staff was courteous too since I only tried one dish I cannot vouch for others"
4102,Ugadi,1,Worst service Food quality n price inversely proportion  Needs to revamp the staff n cook  Would rate 1 on 10 First time walked without completing the food 
4103,Ugadi,2,I tried Andhra meals expecting Andhra relish  I am not satisfied with the savour more over the head waiters are too rash  The restaurant is expensive
4104,Ugadi,2.5,"Well Mixed feelings First of all I believe that the owners were asleep midway because they couldnt even place the the direction boards correctly ended up walking two by lanes before reaching the restaurant

Being from Andhra myself I have quite expected a lot from this place and i must say that to my dismay all my expectations were shattered

The place was hardly inviting the interiors were basic  and it was terribly hot inside the air conditioning looked just like a prop without any function the waiters were simple folk just carrying on their chores 

Asked them to get a Special Biryani To my relief this biryani came to my rescue It was surprisingly well made It came with an accompanied chicken curry and it really tasted well This was the only positive feeling i had when i left this place
Probably wouldt return again"

4110,Ugadi,1,One fo the worst andhra food i have had in my life till now Its just waste of mobey going here the chapathi are very small that in two bites it gets over n everytime i asked chapathi he gets rice and tells sir rice i was pissed the way they were serving they were getting chapathis as if i have asked their kidney the rice is not of a good quality i have heavy gas in my stomach after i had food here and rasam was too much sour and it was full of tamrind and sambar was sweet then palya was just waste and dal was bland even i had put salt it was too bland One of the worst places so my recomendation is dont go here if u want andhra food
4111,Ugadi,4.5,Great place for Andhra style food The chicken biriyani we had was the best we ever had The places can be easily found It can get a little clumpsy if you are visiting in the peak hours Nevertheless the wait is worth the food you eat
4112,Ugadi,1,Wish i could rate lower And had a chance to have food After ordering meals and waiting for an hour the waiter tells us theres no rice Jaynagar has much better places Never come come here

Pathaga bhojanam thats what they call meals was average for the price not very good
Fried chicken piece biriyani was something new for me in the menu  tried it Didnt find a fried chicken piece inside it It came like jeera rice with chicken piece and masala But was tasting good

Decent seating  good ambience Not heavy on pocket"
4122,Ugadi,4,"Ugadi is one of my favorite restaurants for Andhra Style Food I am going here from very long time for authentic meals We cant compare this restaurant with any other Andhra Style restaurants
Food quality and taste is entirely different here but trust me this is a best place to go with family
My all time favorite is Veg Biryani and Andhra Style Meal here
One of the other best part is Ambiance and hygiene They maintained the restaurant very neatly and we should appreciate the Management for that

4170,Ugadi,1,"Food tastes stale chicken is not fresh
I strongly dont recommend
one positive aspect is the location otherwise nothing great about this place"
4171,Ugadi,1,"I was at this restaurant last weekend the food was served 45 minutes after the order  i was there at 130 PM that is like the exact time for lunch but still the delay took place the food tasted very bad and i think i should use the word WORST
i am from andhraguntur and was expecting very simple andhra food and they failed to stand upto my minimum expectation
please dont choose this restaurant or dont get dismayed by the rating its just waste of money
I suggest Nagarjuna as a far better place 
MY WEEKEND WAS JUST RUINED "

Great Food dont miss it"
4220,Ugadi,3,The food taste is good and authentic Andhra style But they need to improve on service part They should know that even after they take the order once still some service might be required We had placed for an order once and just wanted to add a few more items but there was none seeing our requirements And the seating capacity is very less but having said that that doesnt mean that on a table of four there will be 2 people on one side and two more on the other side which made me uncomfotable So my suggestion to foodies is just go in to this hotel when there are 4 people or probably you might have to share the table with some strangers
4221,Ugadi,4,my sister treated my whole family in ugadi on Sunday afternoon v made a reservation but as we entered we realized that it was a complete waste the restaurant was fully packed thankfully v got a table as soon as we entered the place luks congested especially on weekends coz its swarming with ppl the waiters serve in haphazard manner nd keep on dropping spoons dey clear the table even before our food has been served fully we got our biryani but not raita until we finished our lunch in spite of all these shortcomings I can tell you that the food was amazing biryani was average but the soup hot n sour and starters steal the show yummy food my mouth waters just by thinking abt it I don care abt the service this is the oly place I would visit again despite the bad service just for the food it serves amazing

4259,Subway,1,"I have visited this place multiple times its like just any other Subway Nothing too great
The reason Im rating this place 15 is because I ordered food from this Subway outlet on Foodpanda Waited for more than 30 mins and the restaurant did not confirm the order When I called them they were like they werent accepting orders from Foodpanda and asked me to speak with Foodpanda customer care When I spoke with Foodpanda customer care they told me the restaurant doesnt want to accept the order Finally my order was cancelled
If they werent accepting orders from Foodpanda then they should have turned the order accepting device off The person with whom I spoke with over the phone was very rude and not one bit apologetic"
4260,Daal Roti,4,good
4261,Daal Roti,1.5,This place is a daily mess and best suited for students or bachelors I will give a big zero to their cleanliness and service They even charge you for onion The price on the menu card is not updated which is really unethical What they serve you when you go and and eat and when you order online is quite different I was so impressed with their taste I ordered the food online that I decided to visit this place and I was very disappointed with their service
4262,Daal Roti,1,This is the worst of all restaurant one can ever come across Once I had asked for a home delivery  literally these people made me wait for two and half hours and then said that they are unable to deliver The food quality used to be decent earlier but now has degraded  The place is also very unclean and you can always expect rude behaviour from the staff
4263,Daal Roti,3,I have been going to this place for a very long time now And i have seen this place change overtime Earlier things were not that good but now i think they might have changed the cooks or something as food tastes better This place is best to satisfy ur north indian food cravings Dishes are little pricey for a small place like this It is best for takeaways as u wont be able to eat over here because of the mosquitos To be on the safe side always order regular dishes and stay away from unique dishes as most of them are horrible If u live somewhere nearby and want to have something north indian u can give this place a try
4264,Daal Roti,3,An average place to eat at if youre having food out on a daily basis Save money and fill your tummy Quality and hygiene issue people do not visit
4265,Daal Roti,4.5,I have been to a this place almost a year back and now i am a regular to this place since then  The best to satisfy your North Indian cravings Would deffinetely suggest this place
4266,Daal Roti,5,Awesome food service is fast they have changed the taste gave the restaurant awhole new look very yummy food the food was also served at Time within 5 minutes of the order was placed

And then quiet expensive"
4270,Daal Roti,3.5,The place is small not a great place to hang out but yeah the food is too good specially chicken items and the people are friendly not even too costly overall its good
4271,Daal Roti,2,The worst place to order from hereThey will never deliver on time and always say someone else took the order and he has left the shop so please repeat the orderIf one wants to starve than can order from here
4272,Daal Roti,3.5,I got my food delivered home from daal roti Food will take ages to get delivered Ordered at 1030 and it got delivered at 12 30 The food was warm kind of tasty I ordered chicken kassa and 4 roti combo egg curry and 4 rotti combo

4274,Daal Roti,3.5,"I would so a ok kind of place to give it a try
Food tastes yummyThe only problem which i feel to be concerned is hygieneAs i found this place can be maintained properly in a tidy manner
Service is good
Must Try  Noodles and other Chinese items"
4275,Daal Roti,3,I eat here often and I always go for the rice thali The food here is good in terms of quality and quantity Spacious seating and quick serving of the food is an added advantage College students are a regular crowd there I would recommend this place for the working people who come after a long tiring day and dont want to cook yet want quality and quantity food Price is pocket friendly and food is worth the price
4276,Daal Roti,2,I have been a regular customer for over a year Started with just one room now they have large space definitely doing good business Vegetarian food are good Nonvegetarian food are average The only bad thing about this place is customer service When I tried to give feedback about the food they were not ready listen Home delivery is worst I stay nearly 100 meters away from this restaurant Every time I have to explain where I stay It was frustrating
4277,The Lassi Park,5,This is like home for me Always love going here late nite Love d kulfi the falooda  brownie sizzler Even d sundae r equally good u should try every variety every time u visit  Lots to explore

4279,The Lassi Park,4,This place is always buzzing with people and is associated with a lot of fond memories This is one the little gems of Jayanagar Their falooda is one of the best in Bangalore Falooda kulfi is my favourite Royal falooda comes a close second The lassi is another must try item Its the best place to beat the heat Frequenting them on a Sunday afternoon has become a regular affair
4280,The Lassi Park,4,So this is like place we go after belting high on hari super sandwich as this place right opposite to it Love their hot chocolate fudge sizzlerAlways refreshing to come back to this place for some desserts If you are around do visit
4281,The Lassi Park,4,"A very busy and crowded place in jayanagar Had been here to try out some drinks
They have many options in their menu Juice shake smoothie falooda etc
Ordered Lichi Shake It was really delicious Perfect chilled and sweetness Usually in other places shakes will be full of ice and too much sweet But this shake was perfect Loved it
Definitely gonna try out other options as well"
4282,The Lassi Park,4,My alltym fav placeThey serve Desi style of icreams n faloooddaaaaaaasBeen here a million timesFalooodaas and fruit salad with ice creams are the best and yymmmmyyy 
4283,The Lassi Park,4,"Located right opposite to Hari Super Sandwich after gulping down all my favorites from there I had to quench my thirst
Most of the time I order for Watermelon without sugar and without ice thats when you can truly taste the fruit for itself Usually I get disappointed but not here
The juice was so FRESH and GOOD I felt healthy after drinking that Haha
And the best part is its at a very affordable price"

4290,Cafe Coffee Day,3,The staff here are a little rude You are not allowed to complain to them  They need to start serving food faster The coffee is splendid but you will have to wait for a very long time for your coffee
4291,Cafe Coffee Day,3.5,"Cafe Coffee Day
A place to end up for typical Coffee culture in the locality since years CCD has made a very good name in Taste and Quality They have their own standards in delivering the product There are several outlets in the area this is 8th block one located opp to Vasudev Adigas Restaurant

They had International Burger Festival  going on but I just headed to try cup of hot coffee
Ordered Vanilla Cafe Latte which was milk based They hardly took 15 min to serve Had ordered for King sized
Vanilla Cafe Latte is something refreshing with vanilla cream and flavour on it

Good and plesent place to sit back and relax for the cup of coffee Outlet was clean and welcoming

4293,Cafe Coffee Day,4,"Wow Im the first one to review this specific Cafe Coffee Day I wonder why there are no reviews yet since this happens to be one of the better CCD branches

Me and an old friend usually meet up here first before we go elsewhere to have a couple of beverages This CCD has been out point for contact for a year now and it was him who introduced me to it It has good outer seating and the umbrellas above the tables provide a nice little touch

The menu is the same as other CCDs so I wont really go into too much detail Strawberry Pom Smoothie Cool Blue Crunchy Frappe and Classic Lemonade are my favourites As always its slightly overpriced The service is pretty good though

4295,A2B - Adyar Ananda Bhavan,4,Location is right on target and this restaurant caters to fast eaters The major chunk of people opt for self service which is faster Try the dosas which come with a range of accompaniments Good spread but the North Indian and Chinese items might take a wee bit longer

We ordered the regular filter coffee and a Mysuru coffee The filter coffee was strong and made just right and managed to satisfy my wife who has pretty high standards for it I too loved the Mysuru coffee and would surely recommend the same
They also serve light snacks to go with the coffee which we left for another visit"

This joint lets you check in both boxes And additionally the taste is also good The rolls arent too oily nor is there any overbearing taste of any sauce
We bought an egg chicken roll and a gobi rollSagar Kathrisal is pure veg

The egg coating on the roll was really fluffy and did not even a bit have the raw egg smell And the chicken was really juicy

Also please not this is not exactly a family restaurant Its more of a stop take and go kind of a place

As long as the food is tasty and easy on the pocket I am always happy"
4353,Kolkata Kathi Roll's,4,The place is meant for all sorts of eaters except families The quantity that you receive for the price is good and eve the taste is fine Mid you find the place too claustrophobic then just get it packed or get them to deliver at your place Whats best is you have them in food panda with good deals Well with the price they offer I really doubt if you need additional deals Try their egg chicken roll Youll not regret it

4516,Shri Vinayaka Ice N Juice,5,Not gonna lie the place is quite crowded and busy which will get on your nerves But its worth it for their tasty chats I had here a week back n have gone back since then coz the taste is that good Their masala puri is really yummy so is their gobi One of the best places to have chats
4517,Shri Vinayaka Ice N Juice,3,Good place for chaat items and juice We tried their masal puri Bhel puri pain puri and lime soda All good except panic puri The puris werent crisp Us too heavy on the onions The Bhel puri portion is quite generous  seems to be a popular place to hand out during evenings No seating though

I have tasted chats Juice and sandwich here where chats like dahi puri and masala puri are good and others are not so impressive Whereas juice i feel that it is not thick as it should be and it doesnt taste good Sandwich is just average The only problem here is the queue that we have to wait for our turn for the chats Not a place to visit in weekends"
4519,Shri Vinayaka Ice N Juice,3,"There was small cafe when i was young in this place Later when the Park opposite to this was remodelled they started this CHats and Juice center

It started attracting all the local people around NagasandraK R Road N R COlonyGandhi Bazaar and was a huge hit

We can go for a quick bite of the actual chats

The menu was regular initially All kind of chats MasalaPani PuriSev and Aloo Poori and Juice center

Later they started Veg Sandwich Samosas

Coming to the taste Masala is not as tasty nowadays compared to before Bhel Puri is good among everything

I have tasted thr sandwich as well It was very dry and sauceketchup was not thick and not tasty

Coming to the juice section they serve the best Mosambi juice in Bangalore I have never tasted a better one than this

4521,Shri Vinayaka Ice N Juice,2.5,Not a big fan of their chaats which always has a weird after taste They also have fresh fruit juice which is okay Food not really unique One of those many fruit chaat centers
4522,My Tea House,4,"So went here with friends for tea The ambience is striking to say the least The posters from tea gardens and a wide variety of tea stories in transparent bottles along with their description on the menu makes them all so tempting to try They have a umpteen varieties of teas from basic chai and lemon tea to variants like saffron and cranberry You name it they have it They also have some food to go with it But since I went there post lunch couldnt try A quiet place on the main road Perfect to hang out after work with friends or even family A good alternative to the mundane coffee shops which have been asking the same variant of coffees for years now Go give this place a try you wont regret it

4863,Cocoa Bakes,2,The cakes here are plain and drab Ate the macaroons there They were tiny and werent even macaroons The taste was bad The cakes were ok nothing great about them Not worth the price

4868,New Prashanth Hotel,4,This place is one of my favourites and has never disappointed me with quality or quantity of food Its surprising how the food tastes the same even as years pass by the menu has limited varieties and everything served on their menu tastes best Personally my favourites have been mudde with two kinds of curry red and green chicken kabab so crispy and good mutton Keema balls and mutton chops the quality of the mutton is to die for
4869,Dwaraka Grand,4,This is the best place in Kumarswamy layout for Breakfast and Snacks Ground floor is normally crowded but we prefer first floor AC section Would rate 5 out of 5 just for Coffee Its too good We come to this place from Katriguppe just for Coffee
4870,Dwaraka Grand,5,Ideal place for me to have my Sunday breakfast and snacks  Good South Indian food and had a good variety of South English and North foods
4871,Dwaraka Grand,2,Went here for breakfast n had masala dosa It costed 42which is quite high compared to other hotels Nevertheless I got the dosa just like how I had asked them to make It was crispy n made with less or no oil Happy with that However it was not complimented well with chutney or sambar Preferred to have the dosa just with the masala Then had coffee n it was given to my liking Strong n sugarless Overall a decent one just above average fare Nothing great or out of the world
4872,Dwaraka Grand,4,Easy on the pockets Menu is a bit different with kodabu mysore masala dosa and few more items from kodagu region Hygenic and at well versed location
4873,Gufha - The President Hotel,5,From the dark Caves candle lit tables spicy Afghani cuisine perfectly cooked Briyani with quality spices  basmati rice and cool curd raitha to complement it makes your taste buds to fill with joy
4874,Gufha - The President Hotel,3,Yes the food was good Had Afghani ghost biryani chaat and chicken tikka It was good The ambience is something to look out for A cave on the fifth floor waiters wearing safari suits covers of the menu in tiger prints A lot to take in Worth your time
4875,Gufha - The President Hotel,4,Love how this place is been running for soo long  The ambience the staff the interiors n food has remained the same  Really tasty food  Love the biryani rasamalai n roti curry  The starters are rich in taste 
4876,Gufha - The President Hotel,4,The restaurant had a unique theme of a cave and the ambience was really great Had been here with my family couple of days back The food was pretty good the mushroom pepper fry was amazing with perfect blend of spices for the fresh and tender mushrooms Chicken tandoori was nothing great just like any other restaurant The chana stuffed paratha was unique and nice  The afgani biriyani was mind blowing its a must try and the paneer gravy also was good Overall this would definitely give you a different and great dining experience
4877,Gufha - The President Hotel,4,The theme and ambience were quite spectacular And the food just added the cherry on top of the cake Apollo fish is a really good dish do try it
4878,Gufha - The President Hotel,4,Had been here on a Saturday night  A cozy cave ambiance with candlelight to jazz up the weekend mood  Courteous staff and delicious food  Ordered pahadi kebab  afghani dum subzi biryani laccha panner jaali  Murgh jalferzi everything was so delicious medium spiced Quality and quantity wise was good  Worth the penny spent  Had Alice in president mocktail which thou tased just like strawberry shake  But overall a nice experience
4879,Gufha - The President Hotel,3,Theme based restaurant Highly priced Dishes are just okay not that great May be a good place for non vegetarians As its in the center of Jayanagar easy to locate
4880,Gufha - The President Hotel,4,"Best one loved ambiance which has wow factor Perfect theme resturant  as name suggest 
Its was unique experience 
Coming to food Chicken starter was best Afghani dum biryani was good

4881,Gufha - The President Hotel,5,Love the place for its ambience and creativity  As the name sounds its literally eating inside a civilized cave Food is awesome  Really recommend Love those qubani ka meeta
4882,Gufha - The President Hotel,5,The ambience is super amazing and one of a kind Provides a feel of cave life experience Just loved it Food is a bit expensive there compared to other places but was great in terms of both quantity and quality The service was good and the people there were courteous enough
4883,Gufha - The President Hotel,4,"The ambience of this restaurant is their USP
Of course the food is delicious as well the menu comprises of North Indian cuisine

Ambience  Even though it is a small place they have maintained it well very hygienic There is no place to sit but there are few tables on which you can keep your hot plates and eat

Service  There is no proper queue at the counter so it is a task to place your order However crowded it gets your food will not be delayed

Food  Menu is similar to Brahmin Coffee Bar but there are you additions like Avalakki Flattened Rice and NavaneMillet bath

I have tried their Idly Vade Kharabath and Avalakki Every dish is served with chutney you dont get Sambar here

All the dishes here are really good but Idly Vada is a must have"
4960,South Kitchen,4,"Yet another oldschool old Bangalore type breakfast joint in Basavangudi Obviously didnt disappoint
Tried the usual
Khara Bhath Idli Vada Kesari  Coffee"
4961,South Kitchen,4,455 This place may not have the legendary status yet as it is relatively new but is surely going to give the other hotels in Basavanagudi a run for their money The crowd swarming around the food court makes you wanna dive right in and eat the food Ive been there twice and am stumped by their crispy dosas and yummy chutney and their filter coffee Filter coffee is not a rarity in Bangalore but there are some places where it should not be missed This is one of them Another important thing is their importance to hygiene even in the extreme rush Im definitely looking forward to my next visit and try their infamous Kharabath and semiya upma
4962,South Kitchen,5,This is among the best breakfast places around basavanagudi The chutney is simply perfect in terms of spice and consistency and goes very well with idli and vada Kesari bath is also very good They keep the place hygienic and service is systematic and fast Dishes have value for money and are very satisfying Will keep visiting frequently
4963,South Kitchen,5,I just love this place Their hot idli chutney and vada avalakki is something to drool about and the thought can make me hungry at any point of day Best part is their filter coffee after a scrumptious breakfast That completes it all
4964,Chung Wah,1,STAY AWAY Dingy dim lit entrance Like a corridor in some dark ghetto life movie Walk up and your greeted by staff lazing in a dark corner oblivious to your presence You dont need any specially honed sixth sense to tell you this place spells doom Isnt there a way to give negative ratings here Like some Golden Raspberry Award or something This review doesnt even deserve more words than this Bah
4965,Chung Wah,4,We ordered American sweet corn soup in the jayanagar branch it was really good  it was served hot Right amount of vegetables were also present
4966,Chung Wah,5,"Today been here for dinner with my family we ordered veg corn soup chicken wings and chicken fried rice soup was so yummy 
Chicken wings are super tasty 
Chicken fried rice  was excellent
Service is good
Ambience is decent
Overall we enjoyed the food this my 3 visit to this place good food  good place and good service too"
4967,Shanthi Sagar,2,Very slow in service and they give preference for service section and parcel onlyself service is ignored waited for almost 1 hour and we still waited lack of staff and nobody to care for us
4968,Shanthi Sagar,1,Worst food Takes some level of genius to mess up simple dishes like bhel puri and masala puri The paneer manchurian was pathetic could only taste tomatoBland and tasteless ingredients were stale giving a bad taste Dont waste your money here
4969,Shanthi Sagar,3,the quantity was awesome but quality was not good and packing was too small due which food came in lumps
4970,Shanthi Sagar,1,no spoons very bad
4971,Shanthi Sagar,2,i ordered North indian food taste and quality was below average and they took 1 hr 15 mints to make it  i was starving when food came i was not hungry anyone bad delivery and bad food
4972,Shanthi Sagar,3,I mentioned do not use dalda but they applied otherwise its good
4973,Shanthi Sagar,1,One of the best example for how not to manage demand supply They take so much order and a simple food item you need to wait for 3040 mins by when your stomach may melt off Food quality is ordinary and you may visit only when there is no other option on earth
4974,Shanthi Sagar,3,"The Hotel is A very old Food seller in the locality of Uttarahalli
This hotel has been newly reconstructed with a impressive look
The food available here is just like any other normal hotel and the taste is Just above average
Both AC and non AC halls are available
Just above the hotel is Party hall that can be rented for function purposes
Food you must not forget to try here is Roti and Dal that is available post evening"
4975,Millet Mama,4,"Its a nice eat out when you walk with NO expectations Clean home made feel of food and service Staff are simple friendly and helpful too For sure there is variety in the food served like dosa dessert favoured rice vada kosambri etc You can view the wide spread in the pictures shared There is obsolutely no commercial aspect attached be it in the ambience or the food served or in presentation Offcourse the entire serving is healthy cause all the variety is made of millets and only millets
A one liner would beMillet mama is mamas food made of millets "
4976,Millet Mama,4,"We got a catering ordered for school kids from this place I got to taste millet laddu millet bisi bele bath millet halwa and everything made of healthy millets Authentic south Indian food made from healthy millets I would recommend this place for anyone put up in and around South end circle

The place is a zero budget investment Its decorated with flowers baskets and fruit packing wood The walls are decorated with warli painting and the ambience feels HOMELY"

4978,Bangarpet Chat Express,5,This place is just my favorite I love the pani Puri and masala Puri It cant get any better The other thing was that when I didnt have the exact change the cashier just let me go that was truly kind 
4979,Prems Graama Bhojanam,5,"Located in Jayanagar 7th Block Prems Graama Bhojanam is a new and refreshing place to have good healthy and delicious food

We had items like Thatte Idly Millet Paddy Jolada Roti Navane Rawa Dosa Benne Masala Dosa Coconut Jaggery Dosa Shunti Kashaya and Majjigae All the dishes are served with delicious sambhar peanut chutney and tomato chutney The water served is RO Water  with Tulsi Camphor Clove Cardamom

Definitely a worth and must visit place One of the most heartening things was that the waiter was from Orissa and in just a short span of 5 months of coming to Bangalore he had learnt how to speak Kannada When I told him I wanted a glass of Buttermilk he said ok sir ondhu majjigae "
4980,Prems Graama Bhojanam,5,"What a brilliant find If you are in the vicinity and need a wholesome goodness filled vegetarian meal do drop in here

Went here for lunch today and place is a homely neat space It was so cute to see a kolam on the dining table and the water they serve has notes of cardamom and cloves and is so unique and refreshing

We ordered the executive millet thali and literally every item was lipsmacking my faves were the crunchy masala vadai millet pulao veggies and especially the Kesarisheera Yummy

The thali is pretty filling and rest assured you will exit with a happy stuffed face They serve their tiffin items post 4pm

Service was super friendly

Totally recommended for a supremely VFM experience

4983,Prems Graama Bhojanam,3,nice place  hardly any people  tasty delicious food but the quantity is very very less  they need to work on quantity n pricing then would definetly recommend it to others 
4984,Prems Graama Bhojanam,3,Prems graama bhojanam a village theme Visited this place several times penning a review today Tulsi water served for drinking is the highlight Paddu outer layer was nice crispy but inside was too hard and just a tasteless dough was disappointed ordering it My personal favourite here is pesarattu only if they serve it crispy The next favourite is raggi mudhae with the vegetable or sprout sambar that they serve really yummy and filling too Millet rawa onion dosa is yummy again only if served crispy Found cost to be too expensive for a dinner rs450 for two for tiffen variety The noon lunch with millet variety rice and South Indian dishes are very filling and different but wouldnt call it yummy Variety rice in millets needs improvement Dessert with black rice is yummy while wheat flour just okies Overall it is mediocre experience but calls for multiple visit cause of the traditional millet based food
4985,Prems Graama Bhojanam,4,"A vegetarian restaurant specialised in millet based dishes All items are made with millet only but it will be one of the tastiest meals ever Amazing tasting  full of flavours  nice decor and vibe Friendly service and huge portions
We tried few items in the menu all tasted great  Loved their sambar rice n idly Desert was good tooi cant wait to come back to try the other items in the menu"
4986,Prems Graama Bhojanam,4,Lovely homestyle millet based meals and snacks Loved the masala Vadas and the thali that came with a millet roti delicious saaru radish subzi tomato millets Sambar and Rasam millets The sweet Pongal was so good
4987,Prems Graama Bhojanam,5,"Lovely Excellent Superb Healthy I had couple of visits So had many dishes during our visits and all are very good in taste Someone has written in review that healthy means tasteless Well This is not true here Its just everyones taste has been developed different way and some people are adaptive to all kind of good taste like me 
Service is very good prompt and welcoming in all experiences
Rating is for food service ambience hygiene altogether"
4988,Prems Graama Bhojanam,5,"Easy to locate exactly opposite to Bangalore International Academy Nice little outlet with a villagebased ambiance
Serving only a range of healthy and yummy milletbased dishes If youre here have the Thalis theyre filling and filled with Variety We ordered the Chapati Oota Mudde Oota and the Executive Millet Thalis And damn they were good
Chapatis were soft and fresh Rassam rice and Bele Bath were made with millets and were good The dosas with the executive thali were well prepared wouldnt know the difference between a regular dosa unless told
In the end I was full and content with the quantity served in these Thalis the buttermilk too was very refreshing on a hot day like today
I sign off on a very positive note and would love to try their snack items as well "
4989,Prems Graama Bhojanam,4,"we head to this restaurant for dinner on Sunday night on advise of a friend

we tried Benne Masal Dosa Ragi Masal Dosa Jwar roti  Sambhar rice  Ghee Roast Dosa Every thing has a great taste  Specially chtanai they serve is very good and tasty In desert we tried Moong Dal payasam

4990,Prems Graama Bhojanam,4,Definetely a must visit place if u want to eat healthy yet tasty foodThe masala red rice dosa with sweet potato paliya was awesomeV enjoyed all the dishes thoroughly
4991,Java City,3,This place we visited as we had to wait for a friend and we had no other place where we could hang out The ambience is not great and since smoking is allowed its not advisable for kids and ppl who dont want to be a passive smoker Food is ok but coffee was good 
4992,Java City,4,This is small cute place near Ramkrishna hospital Ambience is really the best Do agree there are smokers all around but if you want to sit n have a long chat with friends or a loved one than this is the place for sure The charges are reasonable too This ones surely is in my books
4993,Java City,1,This place is for smokers alone The pizza is greasy and all sorts of unhealthy as pizza usually is but quite alright The beverages could be so much better What the place lacks is good staff There are impolite and lack basic courtesydecency One particular waiter forced us to buy food while we were just happy with our coffee The ambiance could be so much better if there was a separate smoking zone Utterly bad experience
4994,Java City,3,There was a time where this place used to be my adda This place serves the best hot chocolate Food used to be delicious and now its average Very slow service
4995,Java City,2,"They have really bad options for food They have consistently bad service This place is heaven for smokers If youre a nonsmoker then Java City is decent to sit and chill for a bit if you can find a place in a corner thats away from the smokers

Also this place is a little hard to find Dont make the effort"
4996,Kamat Bugle Rock,4,If youre craving for North Karnataka vegetarian meals then this is that place Two floors are assigned to serve the meals and the other two floors serves south Indian snacks and breakfast munches Getting a table here will generally takes time due to the rush in peak hours However theres some live carnatic music here to enjoy while waiting for your table The meals is served in a banana leaf which makes it more homely and interesting This costs around 250 inclusive of taxes which makes it very competitive and pocket friendly The overall taste and quality of the food was above average However the service here sometimes gets really slow and I really feel that the restaurant should work on improving this
4997,Kamat Bugle Rock,3,The special North Karnataka meals here is one of the good spreads that you can get It consists of a chilly bhajji holige jowar roti brinjal curry lentil curry green leafy sabji raita rice rasam sambar n curd The overall ambience of the place is alright and the service is ok The speed of service is average Can come to this place once in a while to savour the north Karnataka food There are other joints of course
4998,Kamat Bugle Rock,4,"We have been for dinner  food is really tasty we just loved  this place is good for pure vegetarian ppl toilet is not clean at all they need to maintain the cleaness 
Overall Experience was good"
4999,Kamat Bugle Rock,3,"If you want to taste north karnataka food then kamat bugle rock is the best place for dining

Quite good ambiance with music around the place

Best for family"
5000,Kamat Bugle Rock,1,"Very Disappointing Terrible foodAmbience is okTaste is Pathetic On a Saturday morning except our group of 8no others why such poor quality and tasteheard its going to shed down too

Ppl opt better place"
5001,Kamat Bugle Rock,3,Happen to visit in confusion over a weekend on my fathers birthday Mix vegpalak and tomato soup was next to awesome NEVER try to order Punjabi starters because it is just to increase the menu items and in reality dishes are in Veg kolapuri and mushroom masala was ok for the breads and ghee rice to close the orders was just perfect Jowar roti meals is all time hit over here to try
5002,Kamat Bugle Rock,3,"It has lost its Charisma compared to my past visit
The taste of the food has gone down
This place is easy to locate no problem with the parking

Food is good Ordered Special Roti oota Felt it should have been little more spicy Ambience is good enough

The only 3 rating is because of the service very poor we had to call each and every time we wanted to get served

You need to visit in the weekend if u ever want to listen to some soothing live music Also its better to get your table reserved as it will be crowded in the weekend"
5003,Woodee Pizza,3,"Decided to take a break from my usual Pizza Parlour And also coz I love the Pineapple and Jalapeos combination that many pizza parlours dont make Having found one thst makes it I decided to give it a shot

Tried their
Hot Golden Cake Pizza Pineapple Corn and Jalapeos  dont get fooled by the use of the term cake The pizza was very good  loads of cheese thin crust and served hot What I was disappointed with was the stringent use of Pineapple and corn Pineapple was cut so small thst it was smaller than the corn kernel Very disappointing indeed 

Jalapeo Garlic Bread Didnt much care for it though it was also loaded and bursting at the seams with cheese and Jalapeos
It was too doughy"
5004,Puliyogare Point,3,"Another popular eatery in the Basavanagudi area
The star dish of the place obviously is the one that its named after the humble puLiyogare
After having heard about this place a lot my expectations were set very high accordingly I have to say that the puLiyogare fell short of matching the expectations That isnt to say that it was bad it just was good but not great"
5005,Puliyogare Point,4,As the name says I tried puliyogare here For 40 quantity seems to be less but taste wise it was really satisfying I feel the authentic Iyengar style puliyogare it was Pretty good place with good food
5006,Puliyogare Point,3,We just tried the puliyogare here It was good However having tasted puliyogare at a number of places now we didnt find it any different But then what more can one expect from humble tangy spicy sweet rice just tat I wont take a cab to go to this place just to taste the rice Divesh Thaploo
5007,Puliyogare Point,4,"Dont judge a book by its cover and a restaurant by its appearance Puliyogare Point is one of those tiny eateries with some delicious food

The highlight of the place is their fantastic Puliyogare or Tamarind Rice that tastes exactly like how it would in an Iyengar home The Sakkare Pongal is another delicious dish their version is second to none If youre here also try their Akki Rotti Mini Idli Sambar Ambode Kanchipuram Idli and Ragi Dosa

Some would say the quantity is quite less for the price but considering the quality of the food its totally worth it Do try if youre in and around Basavangudi"
5008,Puliyogare Point,4,One of the good places to eat around Basavanagudi area I tried a bunch of items during a couple of visits to this place and loved the taste of Puliyogare Vangi bath and the sweet Pongal the most They serve good filter coffee as well
5009,Puliyogare Point,4,Its been at off street to DGV road Gandhi Bazaar Had experienced pickup and service both Both are good The signature dish Puliyogare rice is really excellent I have never experienced such taste in my last 15 years experience of same dish Excellence with Perfection no single ingredient overrules other ingredients Great Though their Vada is one piece 20 rs price which seems expensive for this kind of joint But taste is really good only 1 point less because of the price point Ratings are for food and price
5010,Puliyogare Point,4,It is a great place to try variety of rice dishes A very small place with more take away and less seating Sweet pongal is probably the best in the city I like puliyogare and khichdi too This has become one of the favorite places in my office for ordering lunch
5011,Puliyogare Point,4,"The food at puliyogare point appears simple but the flavours are at remarkable depth
With friendly staffs
And coming to the menu
I have tried puliyogare and Coconut rice
But coffee was not that much good"
5012,Puliyogare Point,2,"Ambiance  The shop is divided into two one selfservice and the other is the service area

Service  It wasnt crowded in the morning that we had been here There was a single guy managing the service He would deliver what was asked for and disappear

Price   Food was moderately priced whereas the coffee was priced higher than the other darshini

Taste  We tried the following items

Puliyogare  I had a lot of hopes on this dish as its name is part of their brand I was expecting it to be mindblowing but it turned out to be regular puliyogare that you can easily get elsewhere
Coffee  Inspite of asking to serve it strong it was below average
Medu dosa  khali dosa  This was the best item we got to taste They were filling soft and crispy They were served with chutney average and sweet sambar very good"
5013,Puliyogare Point,5,Had lunch here40 rupees for puliyogare The quantity is less I feel for 40 rupees but it was enough for meThere are other items like mini mealsCurd rice etc availableThe place is divided into two placesOne is self service where you stand and eat and the other is with seating chairs with serviceBoth the departments are beside each other but separated by a wallThe food taste was good and different
5014,Bangalore Agarwal Bhavan,3,Had been here for lunchAmbience is okService is too slowStaff is okPrices are highStreet parkingDint like foodJust average Took lemon coriander soup crispy corn aloo anaar Roti was very hardGravy okCooker biriyani was ok
5015,Bangalore Agarwal Bhavan,4,This place is located really close to where I stay and its definitely my go to place for light snacks in the evening The jalebis here are amazing Must try The Raj Kachori and Tawa Pulao ate good too Would love to visit again thanks 
5016,Bangalore Agarwal Bhavan,4,"A busy restaurant with many options to choose from that includes innovative dosas and sandwiches They have both self service and service sections

We tried three dosa varieties  cheese Schezwan and Pav bhaji I would recommend cheese from these 3 The dosas are very crisp and served with delicious sweet sambar and chutney

Also tried the classic Pav bhaji which was very yummy

The pricing is good with attractive combos making all this tasty food affordable also"
5017,Rustic Stove,1,"Had been for dinner last night to this place as my friend was craving for some Andra Chicken Curry
The ambiance is decent for a fine dine
For starters we asked the staff to suggest something in tandoor He suggested us Murgh Banjara Chicken For main course we ordered Rustic Andra Chicken Curry with plain rice
The starter was very bad It has only garlic flavour on the outer n bland inside Have never had such pathetic tandoor
Well we were hoping that atleast the curry would be good but the curry had no flavour apart from chilly It was just spicy and bad
Very disappointing experience
And the prices are too high for such bad quality food
Not recommend"
5018,Rustic Stove,4,Visited this place for lunch Its a hidden gem in jayanagar Ambience was good and service was fast Pot briyani is must try item Food was tasty

I got to know about this place through zomato gold went for there Dinner with my friend
The staff was really polite and the service was really quick
Coming to the food
I ordered Bamboo biryani which was good but not as good as expected it tasted more like a pulao
Butter naan and butter chicken was yummy
Also dont forget to order dragon prawns hereits the best thing I had herehad all the spices right and was cooked really well

Came here and ordered food The staff just got the naan and roti and didnt get the main course
Turns out he forgot to write it I mean how can you just forget to write the main course and just get the breads
By the time the curry was prepared he took the naan to reheat it and burnt all of them
We ordered Bhindi masala for main course and honey chilli potato for starter Before you order those be careful as they are pretty spicy
The starter was good but the main course was not that great
Wouldnt recommend this place at all

5023,Rustic Stove,4,Nice small cosy place for hangout Not much to offer as we went there at odd time Still they prepared everything fresh from scratch Staff is courteous and ambience good for a small place
5024,Rustic Stove,3,Main attraction here is the biriyani which they serve in mud pots and bamboo containers Though I am not sure if they actually cook in it A decent place with cool interiors
5025,Rustic Stove,4,This place has a very modern take over some indian dishes like pineapple rasam which is delicious They are famous for their bamboo biryani 
5026,Rustic Stove,3,"Good little place
We visited this place on Sunday night for dinner
This place is very small and as around 6 to 8 tables  The ambiance is good 
We order for guntur chicken and the famous bamboo biriyani and it was delicious but the bamboo biriyani taste was not to the expectations
Overall a decent place to have food"
5027,Rustic Stove,2,"Pathetic food we were fully upset after visiting the restaurant and we were fooled We had ordered three sauce pasta They did not know how to make three sauce pasta We visited this in the beginning and we were not happy We just paid the bill and came back Did not even go for second time and did not recommend for friends Hope now they would have found better chef and improved their quality of food
Ambiance is good price was good but only food was disappointing I give two star rating just because of the courteous staff and the hygiene practices followed"

Honest review Nothing great about it tasted like just another ordinary mixed fried rice with a different masala But it had an assortment of veggies in it including broccoli babycorn potatoes etc The chicken pieces were comparatively less
They also need to work on their hygiene standards Not bad for a onetime visit id say

5045,Spice Elephant,5,"This place just cool  with good ambience and slow music and having delicious food is where you find peace Staff very friendly and they have maintained the place so clean The price is average for what the quantity of food they serve
Thom yum Thai soup was best and was treat to mouth roti was soft with that vilaythi paneer was perfect to have for veggie foodies in rice we tried burnt garlic fried rice with vegetables and it was the perfect thing to end"
5046,Spice Elephant,4,Quiet a good family type of place too calm and usually we dont find crowd here panner curry and the deserts is what we had tasted they wer really good but we found it a little expensive
5047,Spice Elephant,2,"I had a very bad experience here
I dont know about a la carte but the buffet was the worst They gave us complementary drink and momos before the buffet The momos were really good
The number of varieties first of all was very disappointing The service was very slow They refilled the food very slowly The starters were okay The main course also was so so There was two gravies with roti and some rice with raitha They had chats sev puri and pan puri which was average But the desert was disappointing They had gulab Jamun and chocolate cake The jamun was not cooked inside There was a cold blob of raw dough inside The chocolate cake also was really hard and not that good
Overall the buffet was a bad experience for me"

One of the good places to try north Indian foodbut depends on ur taste buds Not everyone will like all the items here Specially when u r particular abt sweet and spicy food
Theres buffet available too
We had ordered paneer uttar dakshin and paneer kurchanwas amazing The Gobi hara pyaz and mix veg were average"
5049,Spice Elephant,3,A decent place for a family lunch or dinner well arranged in a simple manner Food was tasty and the crew was very helpful and understanding
5050,Just Thindi,4,rice bath was good but the potato palya in masala dosa was not good it seemed like old leftover palya
5051,Just Thindi,4,Chatni was very less
5052,Matru Sagar,3,Good and reasonable food and pricing Masala dosa and coffee tastes best Ive been regular there since my school days You can expect north indian thali and chinese manchurian too
5053,Matru Sagar,1.5,Very high price for the bland food they prepare Potato palya in masala dosa was spoilt Gobi manchuri and fried rice are too bland Staff here behave like they have never seen a girl
5054,Matru Sagar,3.5,"This place is on my go to list when Im hungry and at this part of town
Ive had breakfast here quite a few times  apart from the North Indian style food that they serve
In my opinion the breakfast here isnt as good Ive had poor experiences with the masala dosa cmon who can mess this up where the dosa was not completely cooked the first time and then when I told them about it the next time and asked them to roast the dosa they burnt the dosa
I have enjoyed their soups paneer chilly and North Indian dishes like roti Kaju masala paneer butter masala etc
I would go here only for their North Indian and not for their South Indian dishes"
5055,Matru Sagar,3.5,Decent south and north Indian dishes Taste and quality is good Bustling with people of all gen Been my favorite for so many years Best try Masala dosa and awesome coffee
5056,Matru Sagar,4,Being a regular visitor to this part of the town I have had breakfast and evening snacks here many many times Perfect place for a quick bite without pinching your pocket Although a selfservice place there a a few tables and the place is quite big The best part is their quick service  Idlis dosas and the other usual suspects are all yummy but do not miss their pav bhaji and masala puri in the evenings
5057,Matru Sagar,2.5,One of the most overrated place Food is just the normal compared to rest of the hotels Quantity is less than the others Nothing special about it
5058,Matru Sagar,3.5,"This used to be our after college hang out place loads of memories here
Food is served fast and relatively good taste Love the chats there"
5059,Matru Sagar,3.5,Good dosas in early mornings Nice and simple idlis Nice curries Taste 355  cost 55 service 55 hygiene 355 They need to step up on their hygiene
5060,Matru Sagar,4,"When i was broke during my college days and needed some food  matru sagar was always to the rescue with very economically priced items  Their paper masala dosa can fill and entire clan of hungry people with its quantity 

Must go for people around banashankari "
5061,Matru Sagar,4,"Ive been a regular there for 8 straight years 2006  2014 I guess Ive at least spent a lakh or so there Its the place thats practically introduced me to Kannadiga food The quality has always been very good and the mini meals are a treat

This place was a hallmark of my college life as I lived in the neighbourhood Cant believe that Im reviewing it here after all these years

Saar ille na parcel"
5062,Matru Sagar,3.5,I dont know how many times Ive visited this place I stayed in one of the adjacent cross roads so one can imagine Their south and north Indian both are good and tasty Though i like the rotis subzis much 
5063,Matru Sagar,2.5,Usual South Indian restaurant nothing exceptional about the place A place you may go only if u stay nearby and don want to travel at all to eat 
5064,Matru Sagar,1,Bit carefullysometimes they serve embedded cockroaches in idliesit happened to us twice Some times there will b cockroaches under the table wher we eat and climbs table to join for breakfast with you
5065,Matru Sagar,2,This is a self service restaurant Badly maintained Taste Cant be compared with UD or Adigas Chats are terrible
5066,Matru Sagar,3.5,This is one of the darshinis in the area that serves decent north Indian food Pocket friendly decent taste They have Good menu  south Indian north Indian and indo  chinese
5067,Matru Sagar,2.5,Ok
5068,Matru Sagar,5,Good food  North Indian dishes are good Fast food joint even has place to sit and eat
5069,Matru Sagar,4.5,"I visit often when I dont feel like having food at home Food is always good Especially Idly Sambar and masala dosa Try gobi manchuri and baby corn manchuri It will be too crowded Quality is too good and they maintain the standards Best restaurant in Hanumanthanagar locality Only disadvantage is that they dont have service

5075,Matru Sagar,5,Pretty good have been eating here for the past 7years are so the taste never changed
5076,Matru Sagar,3.5,"The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Matru Sagar is their mouth watering Paneer Butter Masala and of course the crowd I didnt know Matru Sagar has branches until recently but apparently they do There is one on Mysore Road too close to Bapuji Nagar junction I have only been to this location though

I guess I might have put on 5extra delicious pounds just by eating Matru Sagars paneer butter masala I used to frequent this joint during its busy lunch hours and their time management during those busy hours is much better than any other regular hrs One would expect to wait longer during rush hrs and to be served quicker during nonrush hours But for some reason it works the other way around in here May be something to do with the manpower I guess

Anyways the point is Matru Sagar serves delicious food every single time and has a lot of returning customers So stop by next time you are in the area and do not forget to try their Paneer butter masala"
5077,Matru Sagar,1,The food was wonderful until I got a coin very recently in onion dosawouldnt even mind to give a negative rating if there was an option
5078,Matru Sagar,4.5,"The best fast food restaurant more than 10 yrs delighting its customers

5129,Sea Spice by 7 Star,4,"Happened to go here with a friend of mine who had come from the US Her and I have been meaning to visit this place from 2013 but it never happened till now

Ordered the prawn ghee roast krab masala kori roti chicken gravy and appam The food was yummy and cooked to perfection
I had ordered a beer and it wasnt cold enough Service was pretty quick and I enjoyed the whole experience"
5130,Sea Spice by 7 Star,4,A fine place to dine with your family Its a treat for sea food lovers Great service Drinks are genuinely pricedThere is a separate area for smokers Most importantly ample space for car parking 
5131,Desi Dawat,5,This is quiet a new place near Dayananda Sagar college This place serves some amazing Chinese dishes the quantity and quality of food is apt for the price paid Though the place is quiet small so dining in might be a little conjusted but you can always get your order delivered to your place Triple schezwan fried rice is one of my hot favorite at this place
5132,Desi Dawat,2,Looks so good but the taste Not even work the money kababs not properly fried the biryani has no aroma short and simple not at all recommended
5133,Cafe Aira,4,A cute little cafe located in Basavanagudi finding it was tuff The food was tasty we tried their Jalapeno poppers Alfredo pasta and Schezwan rice The quantity was little less for the price but overall good experience
5134,Cafe Aira,3,I have been curious about this place since it has pita on the menu We ordered in from Aira today Looking at all reviews here I decided it was best to try pizza pocket As promised it was hot and cheesy It is tasty but it could be better in terms of vegetables used and how cooked they are As for the falafel roll  it is a fail  the sauce used just doesnt go with it All Lebanese rolls come with dips as the bread is too dry You guys should really relook at the way you are pairing food
5135,Cafe Aira,4,"Eaisly identifiable in vv puram roadbasavanagudi
This place gives a homely experience with friendly staff The place is very clean with fine arts on the wall Though the place isnt hugebut is peaceful
Food 1ordered classic nachos which was really great at taste with salsa mayo
2pizza pocket was quite interesting where the ingredient are stuffed inside which was really hot and good
3veg cheese pasta was really creamy and tasty
4 mojito though the quantity was less but it was refreshing

5139,Penthouse Cafe,4,"Small cosy covered rooftop place provides just the right menu for quick bites as well as main course

The view is pretty in the evenings due to glass walls The ambience is good for a small gathering and hang out Not exactly the kind of place for fine dining

It doesnt seem to be like a popular hang out It is hard to even know if a cafe is existing there

Having Zomato gold membership works out well It was due to that we identified the place and went till there to utilise the benefit Thank you Zomato for the Gold  

We tried Veg Steak pasta pizza and sizzler
They provide thin crust pizza All the dishes were good and we enjoyed the food

Giving 4 because the service was slower than expected It could improve

All in all its a quiet place and food price is slightly on the higher side considering the ambience and quantity but its worth it since it tastes good One could give it a try"

5143,Penthouse Cafe,2,"Penthouse Cafe is located in Banashankari Its on the 4th floor and is right opposite to Cafe Coffee Day on the main road First the place seems really shady The entrance is weird and you feel better only after ending up on the 4th floor
The place is really tiny and seems good Only thing that seemed nice about the place We had the Nachos cheese and salsa The mayo along with this was so runny and milky The cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didnt have any Next up my friend and I tried the pink sauce pasta The pasta was overcooked The sauce wasnt creamy at all It lacked in taste It had garlic bread along with it and it tasted decently But highly disappointed with this place I took my friend to this place with a lot of expectations and we were disappointed"
5144,Penthouse Cafe,4,Situated in upper floor this cafe wasnt much known to me if I wouldnt find it in zomato It was bit early when we entered hence there were hardly 24 ppl in the cafe A small call place it was with light music We had ordered veg pasta BBQ chicken wings Peri Peri pizza All tasted good Pasta could be better Service was good
5145,Penthouse Cafe,5,Best place to have food and a very friendly staffed cafe Price is very reasonable and the drinks are really really amazing  No comments of this cafe as everything was very goodthey also have a smoking zone
5146,Penthouse Cafe,1,"Disappointing A friend of mine had told me its a below average cafe but I did not believe it looking at the ratings Visited myself today and he was right Masala tea was not even brewed and was made out of tea bags which was priced at 120 Rs Left it after two sips

Pesto Garlic bread was average but was priced at 200 Rs Virgin mojito tasted like it was just sweet sugar syrup with a hint of lime

Overall not worth the price being charged for the quality of food Not sure about their other food items as i did not even wanted to venture further when the tea arrived"
5147,Penthouse Cafe,4,35 would be the actual rating but would not like to discourage hence 4 There are much better options available surrounded The place again a rooftop convert to a restaurant small well done interiors for its type and nice lighting and good view from top during evening Tried sizzler and rice both were average nothing much to say but okay as an alternative price not match for what we get
5148,Penthouse Cafe,4,"A casual and not very expensive dining place in Banashanki which is not very hard to locate
It is a rooftop cafe in the fourth floor giving it a amazing view

We ordered the Nachos Cheese Salsa BBQ Chicken Grilled Burger and the must try Jalapeno Cottage Cheese Burger

The Nachos were good and I loved the sauce they gave it with
The burgers where really sloppy but super filling in which the BBQ Chicken Grilled Burger was good quite similar to any other BBQ burgers
But the must try Jalapeno Cottage Cheese Burger is something I wouldnt recommend

Overall they have a great ambiance and an okayish food

Peace"
5149,Penthouse Cafe,4,"Easily located The cafe is on the last floor of the building with cute ambience Me and my friends went here for some evening coffee and chit chats Its perfect for catching up friends over a coffee

Staff was friendly and courteous

Would visit to try more"
5150,Penthouse Cafe,1,If possible I would give even less The pizza is horrible as they serve it on precooked pizza bread Makes the pizza super chewy The worst of all was the main that we ordered They gave us raw chicken and when complied about it they just cooked the same chicken again making it over cooked and super chewy Would not recommend it to anyone

5680,South Grand,4,One of the best restaurants in Bangalore for vegetarians Though they offer usual menu food is tasty and delicious Value for money for the items offered
5681,Catch-up-ino,1,"This place is right opposite to the theatre and remember youll have to climb up all the way up to 4th floor as theres no lift You will be tired by the time you reach unless you are a fitness freak
Well for starters asked the man to give me his best shot of hookah so we could come back and surprisingly he gave us the worst of it Asked for a strong but got a tasteless flavoured was a mix of 3
Avoid masala french fries as they were bad it looked like he just put all the Mirchi he had in the kitchen
I wish I would have taken the pic
A cool place to hangout when your girl is getting a hair treatment in perimeter salon
Nevertheless it was okay I hope they would improve their ambience and service

Bombay masala quesadilla
Corn and pimento lasagne

Bombay masala quesadilla  basically its a tortilla filled with masala cheese and vegetables The filling inside was very tasty and good

Corn and pimento lasagne  this is a combination of a lot of cheese at the top and corn and rice with mild spice in it It was very hot when the order was received The taste of cheese can be felt in every bit of it Kids will love this one

5884,The Airos,3,"Had been for reviewing here
Wellthe place is just located opposite to the National college in jayanagar 7th block
This cafe welcomes you with the plants kept outside which I really liked
The place is small and clean with cute little seatings 
Food
1Garlic bread with cheese was crispy and cheesy and was really consistent
2pesto Melody pizza I loved the flavor of the pizza It had all capsicum toppings which was yummy ButI felt it was salty
3 Lasagna a la Mexicana it was salty Could have been better
4Choco mug with vanilla ice cream I would really recommend you all to order this
This was the best
The mug had hot chocolate brownie which was topped on by vanilla ice cream It was deliciously delicious 
Service was kinda quick"
5885,The Airos,4,Cute cafe located in Jayanagar good food with cute ambience An apt place to grab a quick lunch We had coffee and sandwiches I really liked it Actually my visit to this place was a happy accident

Brilliant Ambience with friendly staffs Each and every recipe Except Soup which we ordered were good at its taste

Started from Tomoato Soup

Cheese Balls
Nuggets
Pasta
And pizza 

Prices are reasonable compared to surrounding cafes Personally I liked this place

Overall 455

mustvist cafe airos"
5887,The Airos,4,Looking for a place for a quick lunch we landed at this small cafe They mixed up our orders but were sweet enough to rectify their mistake The pastas were simple and delicious The best part is that they have half portions too The iced tea was average and the mushroom cheese bombs were good Coming to the pricing it is quite reasonably priced making it a good option if you are looking for a budget friendly place
5888,The Airos,5,Believe it or not I have been ordering in from Airos everyday for a week now Im in love with their pasta and quick service when it comes to delivery They have half and full portions Half is more than enough for one person but if you feel like diving into a huge bowl by all means go for the full portion Their Arrabiata is absolutely perfect  tangy balanced and spicy I rarely ever have Alfredo as most places make it too milky or bland This by far compares to the best Alfredo I have had And their Aglio Olio is a classic choice Looking forward to dining in and having a lasagna next time
5889,The Airos,4,Stopped for a quick bite here and had an excellent experience The extra hot sandwich really hits the spot in terms of heat and freshness The mint cooler was subtle and great as well Great place
5890,The Airos,5,"This review is based on online order

I was searching for the veg restaurant which serve pizza and noticed this italian restaurant

I ordered classic Margarita Pizza and Garlic Bread

Both were excellent in taste Especially Garlic Bread which was yummy

Pizza was of thin crust and tasted great

Packing was excellent and
Totally worth for money

Definitely love to visit this place and try other varieties"

Banana Cake is more tastly and i loved itmust try it once surely u will love itand we Orderd a Purple tea and Dum chai Purple Tea is one of the best tea it was quite good
One of the finest chai shop in the localitycost wise its not much Costlier and Worthy too
All in all a good option if u r looking for a freshly brewed Chai in Jayanagar which has a plethora of Filter coffee places this place is a welcome change
My Recommendation is order a Dhabeli in kedias fun food just next door and quaff it down with a Purple tea or a Dum chai

5895,Kirthi's Biryani,3,New place though its a biryani placeI tried Chinese food Best thing is the quantity too good for the price Food was kind of oknot great Definitely worth the price A slight improvement with the taste will make the place a favourite
5896,Kirthi's Biryani,3,Had been here to enjoy ice cream but was not happy They have tried something new but did not succeed I suggest them to try something innovative as other Icecream ships do Havent tried their wood fire pizzas still But friends have suggested that pizza is tasting very good
5897,South Point Pub,4,Indeed a good place This place is not very posh but calm place to hangout It is just below the southend metro station  The food here is really affordable  the quality as well as quantity is up to the mark The prices of the liquor is also nominal Masala papad n baby corn manchuri is our all time favorite which is always accompanied by one large budwiser  The staff here are very kind and they do good service Food is prepared quite quickly and served

5908,Sri Krishna Darshini,2.5,An average place to have cheap veg food This place is clean and quiet crowded during peak hours Tasted their filter coffee and gobi manchurian which was quite good Overall a budget place to have food if visiting nearby
5909,Sri Krishna Darshini,3.5,This is a small place near kiims college maybe not really walkable but a good option in comparision to different college canteens available in the premises Here u can get anything from north indian to south indian to chinese I cannot guarantee about the chinese but south indian and north indian is more than eatable infact good I mostly prefer idly bisibele bath kadai paneer naan and few more things Naan wont be that good might even feel a little tight so it would be better to go with butter naan Overall food is ok for once a while visit This place is mostly crowded and hot so be prepared in advanced Pricing is reasonable

This restaurant is run by the famous Ganesh Sweets Chain of Chamrajpet fame
The restaurant is a multi stored building which has party hall AC seating dining area and Non AC seating ground floor section We chose to dine in the ac lounge
The interiors were bright and neatly maintained We started of by ordering Baby Corn Manchrian which was crisp and medium spicy Our next order was Butter Naan Kulchas and Veg Kohlapuri
The Naan and kulcha were very soft and buttery and the gravy was very rich and thick and was a delight
Our next order was Tawa Pulav which was served alongside Raitha and was upto the expectation
They serve good quality food and the pricing is very reasonable which makes it a very good and a dependable option

6493,Mylari Biryani Family Restaurant,5,This is the small place but with very good service we are been their for Many number of times this is one of the best place to eat biriyani and now they have introduced mutton biriyani meal and chicken biriyani meal with is fill with fully moth watering biriyani kabab and many more 
6494,Mylari Biryani Family Restaurant,2,One of the worst Donne biryani ever I had quantity as usual taste feels like some normal rice with boiled chickenthe pieces very small and less amountthe gravy not good over all for 110 rs definitely not recommended
6495,1980s Games Cafe,4,A very nice place for board game lovers I can recollect my childhood there There are various games and comfortable seating and they have variety of food Tried their Maggi and Paneer StartersIt was nice One can opt this place for relaxation and good food
6496,1980s Games Cafe,3,"One who want to spend time by playing with friends or dear ones do visit this place located in Basavngudi

Quite nice place to play with lot and lot kind of Indore games by paying and having

Some offer available there for price I dont remember exactly what it is

Seating is bit uncomfortable and food is also okay type Other than that types of games they provided or service is really good

Best place to refresh and chill

Overall 355 "
6497,1980s Games Cafe,2,Not worth your money or time It is the first floor of a house converted into a cafe Air conditioning did not work when we had gone and they refused to open the windows for some reason Menu is decent but quality of food was below average The white pasta was pretty bad we couldnt finish it Maggi was okay They charge 100rs for an hour Id suggest you to get your own games and sit at home and chill with some friends
6498,Kadala Tarangaa,1,ordered chicken ghee roast no ghee not authentic Mangalore food just like a fast food chicken shop dont go for it
6499,Kadala Tarangaa,1,Bad experience received re fried fish in thali which was apparently left over n stale fish  was smelling foul when receivedwould not recommend

6503,Kadala Tarangaa,2,Very stale and bland food It is not worth the money Not much variety for 100 in the fish thali Rice curry n sardine rawa fry None it tasted good
6504,Kadala Tarangaa,1,boiled rice was rotteni will never prefer to any onei threw the rice it s d platform to express my feedback on d food i got delivered by kadala tarangaabeing a mangalorean i know how boiled rice will be
6505,Kadala Tarangaa,1,"We were at work when my colleague ordered a chicken biryani from Kadala Taranga The delivery was super fast The food was just average The problem I had was with the packaging They gave us some sort of sweet pink coloured water in a half torn package When I removed the rubber band it spilt all over me And after a while my clothes started turning green in colour After 15 mins it started itching wherever the water had spilt on me Am not sure what exactly caused that Theres usually nothing I am allergic to but am really not sure what was used in that water either

I just had to rant this out and bring it to the restaurants notice I had to rush home and consult someone about this

Sorry to say this but I dont think I would like to order from here again and I wouldnt recommend the place to anyone either"
6506,Kadala Tarangaa,1,Worst Food toomuch spicy can even bit also non sense hotel Thu

6775,Hotel Pork Paradise,4,A typical Naati style restaurant with a simple ambience and a limited menu though there are 4 to 5 pork dishes Most of the pork dishes were quite good the pork fry pepper dry and chilli being the standouts and the portions were sufficient for two people Nothing at all for vegetarians though they will whip up a good egg burji or egg masala They have a bringyourown booze policy even though they dont have a licence to serve liquor so everything works just fine Overall a good middle class eatndrink after a long day place

6784,As On Fire,1,Hygiene is a concern Though not intentional got the scare of my life when I saw owner lady and her assistant fix the Dustbin and compress its content next was to go and start touching the dough for pizza without sanitizing or washing hands Bad part is they are not equipped Using manual balloon air filler for barbeque fire starter one wind is enough to make your food dusty both while eating and during preparing
6785,As On Fire,1,They dont know how to make pizza Pizza sauce was watery So pizza was soggy It was half cooked Expensive for the price we paid Worst food

6864,Curry Leaves,5,"Curry leaves is an multicuisine restaurant specializing in chinese mangalorean and Indian cuisine
The ambience is a huge space consisting of two floors  The first floor being the fine dine and the second being the bar

The place is mostly crowded on weekends

Some of the recommendations here are

1 anjal masala fry fresh fish and yummy masala

2 prawn ghee roast super amazing highly recommended However the vegetarian version made with mushrooms is equally awesome

3 prawn ghassi with kori roti yummy and healthy option

4 chicken malai tikka done right

5 crispy corn  classic bar bite paired well with my pint of beer

In desserts the gulab jamun was done nicely

The service is quick and prompt and the waiters are always eager to please"
6865,Curry Leaves,5,"Multicuisine fine dine restaurant in Bangalore

Curry leaves is a multicuisine restaurant located near yediyur lake in Jayanagar
The ambience is spread over two floors with the first being a family dine in and the second floor being a bar 
However drinks are served on the first floor as well

The ambience resembles a family fine dine space flanked with comfortable sofas tables and curtains

The food here consists of Indian tandoor and Chinese variants along with some classic cocktails

I would highly recommend the seafood specialities here as its is tasty as well as reasonably priced

1 prawn ghee roast must try

2 anjal tawa fry

3 Mangalore style prawn ghassi with neer dosa

4 malai chicken tikka

5 crispy corn

All of the above dishes are highly recommended out here  the mushroom ghee roast is an great vegetarian alternative for the same

In desserts the gulab jamun and gudbad is worth a try

The service is prompt and nice"
6866,Curry Leaves,4,"I visited this restaurant for a Sunday night dinner and it was occupied by mostly families in no time Its an Andhra cuisine restaurant so would be an apt choice for people who love spicy food

In the starters I loved the rich Prawn ghee roast
The mains consisted of Makai palak which was sweet corn and spinach curry NILGIRI MURGH and a mildly flavoured Mangalorean dish Prawn Gassi curry along with neer dosa
I also tried the crispy kora rotiwhich is made of rice and a speciality of Mangalore with chicken curry
We ended the meal with gulab jamun and Gadbad in desserts

missfoodaficionadowordpresscom"
6867,Curry Leaves,4,"Its a nice place with convenient parking Suited for a casual dinner with friends or family The pricing is placed very correctly For the kind of food quality and service they provide the pricing point of around 1200 for 2 is absolutely fine

In the starters the mushroom ghee roast khafila roast chicken and prawns ghee roast tops my list They go very well with any cocktail I specially liked the Pina Colada and Long Island Ice Tea 

In the main course Deewani Handi Nilgiri Murgh and Mutton Chop Masala are the must try

The meal ended with a very enjoyable brownie and Gadbad ice cream sundae 

I will recommend a visit to try the delicacies and the place has all the right things to easily become a regular hangout place"

6967,Magic Meals,3.5,If youre looking for a quickbyte and a place to spend good time with your folks this is the place you could consider going Though the dishes were a little over priced they were deleicious The Baby Corn Manchurian Sandwich was really yummy and is a must try The ambiance is quite small and not so spacious One should be very cautious of the staircase else they might hurt their head This apart the staff were friendly
6968,Desi Cream Junction,4,Visited this placed based on Zomato reviews Ambience decentOrdered tomato shorba which was awesome some cheese veggie rolls coated with some greens which was decent Jeera rice with papad gravy which was sooperb thou the quantity of gravy was very less we asked for more and the waiter politely got some more surprise element was a complimentary palak halwa which was simply out of this worldyummperfectjust perfect
6969,Desi Cream Junction,1,I ordered a sizzling noodle without onions and garlic from Desi cream junction but the restaurant sent it with onions and garlic  They asked me to reorder but I was not able to do soMy complain was not undertaken This was my last order with zomato againI am not going to order again

7070,Ruchi's Corner,1,"This place serves one of the most horrible food in the town
Happened to order gobi manchurian which reached me after 70 mins
On seeing the quantity itself I was irritated
When I opened the box believe it or not the food tasted so bad and had some horrible smell that I had to throw away the food
Just a couple of pieces actually upset my stomach enough to keep me up all night
Please do not order from here
Ive reviewed nearly 70 restaurants till date but never have I ever been so angry in my life
Worst experience ever"
7071,Tandoori Bytes,3,Definitely something which is pocket friendly The quantity is good as well Quality of the food is above average Their Kheema paratha is great Biryani is quite filling but just okay in taste One Chicken Tikka roll is sufficient to fill you up Ambiance is decent
7072,SGS Non Veg - Gundu Pulav,2,"One of my friend referred this place for me so we went all away from Jayanagar to banashankari

Finally we reached Gundu pulav  nothing much to say about ambience  went and ordered chicken biryani and its self service place

And finally Gundu pulav is in table seriously its not at all good so disappointing

Quality was good
Rice quality was not good
Place is quite clean"
7073,SGS Non Veg - Gundu Pulav,4,"Was a good place for a good non spicy Pulavand served well in traditional way

I like as it was flavored lightlyand complements are just right

Love to visit again"
7074,SGS Non Veg - Gundu Pulav,5,A very old legendary and famous pulav Specialist they are You can have this anytime and everytime Its good to see them giving franchise to almost every one and most of them are youngsters The pulav tastes amazing You need to add the pepper salt they provide to chicken or mutton pulav This increases the taste of it In the recent days they have introduced few new dishesstarters Fish kabab out them is the amazing one I recommend all the dishes here
7075,Keventers,3,Good taste not so favourite to overhype though Had hazel nut shake quantity is too less for the price they charge No seating available You can take the bottle for youself 
7076,Sree Sagar,3.5,"Visited this restaurant recently  The restaurant is located in yarab Nagar near monotype  BNM college junction quite visible from the main road 

Coming to food I ordered a plate of parotha and it was quite good  the parotha was freshly made and hot I wish it was roasted just a little more but it was good enough  You get 2 parotha in one plate the size of it is also quite adequate  You get chutney and saguu with it  The chutney is quite normal the saguu was good it was filled with veggies and right amount of spice 

They had filter coffee and a young kid was making it  so the coffee decoction to milk ratio was a little of but you can tell him how of it you want and hell put that much 

The place is quite small and can seat about 10 people and another 10 can stand and eat with tables So not much of an ambeince 
The place is clean though 
The prices are quite nominal the price one plate parotha was 30 bucks 

Overall a pretty good old styled darshini "
7077,Navi Food Point,1,"Stael fud No taste in food at all
Ned to chek kwality b4 serving 
Menus opshions are very very less 
Kwality cant be comprimosed for food"
7078,Navi Food Point,1,"For a store thats placed right in the middle of a Polluted Road  I cannot how someone can guarantee the Quality and Edibility of its food

SevPuri and other chaats are priced at twice the normal rates even when the only place to sit and stand is on the Footpath

The taste of the food doesnt make up for these shortcomings either

Much better options are just a furlong away"
7079,Navi Food Point,4,A hole in d wall kinda outlet just before Gandhi Bazar Theres just place to sit for two people otherwise stand out n eat He makes d food fresh right in front of u We had Tawa Pulao and Pav Bhaji Both tasted good Generous helpings of raita with d Pulao Prices are pocket friendly Nice place to eat tasty food without feeling d pinch
7080,Navi Food Point,2,Food is good but pricing wise its very costly also the food quantity is decent enough but not appropriate to the amount they are charging
7081,Navi Food Point,4.5,A small place near North road flyover  hygenic food affordable rates and extremely tasty  mouthwatering snacks  Definitely worth visiting more than once
7082,Shawarma Inc,1,"The first time I ordered from here I was really happy But after that it was downhill

I ordered the shawarma plate a bunch of times and recently I ordered the jumbo version twice but I got even lesser chicken than the normal quantity both times The kubbos becomes hard by the time its delivered and of late Im getting more veggies and less meat and today when I ordered the SI Special shawarma plate I got no fries AT ALL Its there in the menu but not on my plate Maybe it was a blessing because the fries are soggy by the time it reaches here and Ive noticed a lot of people complaining similarly Sad place

They take advantage of the fact that because its delivery you cant return it If you want shawarma this is not the place to order from"

7085,The Cafe Nuts and Bolts,1,Worst PastaI ordered white sauce pasta instead I got red sauce pastathat too with rancid tastewill never order from this restaurant again
7086,The Cafe Nuts and Bolts,1,I had ordered both veg and non veg pasta with white sauce and it wasnt up to the mark There were no spice or flavours added to it plus it was so dry Not gonna order anymore from here
7087,The Cafe Nuts and Bolts,3,"The place is very close to DSCE and yet I hadnt visited it for a while
Finally got an opportunity The place is quite expensive and neither the quality or quantity of food is good enough for the money
The ambience is unique but still not maintained very well Loud music floor seating seesha and lights is something different that this place offers you
Good for match screenings and hangout with friends

But if youre going just for the food You might be disappointed"

7091,AM WOW,4,Another small joint in Bylanes of Jayanagar 4th block they have only 2 items in their menu the famous Madurai Jigarthanda with and without icecream  By the look of the place we can observe that they do not prepare the jigarthanda there when enquired they said they get supply from SS Dairy foods which has made a very good name in Madurai jigarthanda shops in Madurai Taste is good one can have this after a good meal very soothing

7101,Eat Repeat,4,"This is a nofrills place in NR colony that serves yummy South Indian lunch at affordable prices Hygienic healthy and total VFM
Must have Sweet Pongal RiceMajjigehuli Puliyogare and Masala Majjige
The place is open only for lunch between 1130 am and 3 pm or until the food lasts and is a hit among the professorsteaching staff from the nearby APS college and people who would want to take away food note that you will have to carry your own boxes to take away food from here

7102,Eat Repeat,2,"Heard a lot about this restaurant and the food With expectation had been to this place on last Saturday at around 200 PM Place was Crowded  decent and especially more for takeway We have to collect tokens and go further inside to collect food Yes its a selfservice and few chairs are available to seat We ordered Puliogare chapatti with bhindi curry and sakkarai pongal
Puligare was some what balanced in spices and ok in taste But bhindi curry and chapatti are very disappointing too much of sweetness into curry and totally not good Even we felt high sweet in sakkarai pongal Even the people who serve food have lot of attitude issues while serving food

Food price is nominal and pocket friendly

7103,Eat Repeat,5,I tried puliyogare and ambode And I like the puliyogare but ambode was a little cold one of the best authentic Iyengar hotels in Basavanagudi price is very cheap but the quality is good

I didnot have food in this place but a take away First things firstLoved ther paintings Prices start from 5rs to 30rs Yes you read it correctly Visit the place to witness the same

I took Puliogare and Ambvode it was packed well I stay 10 minutes away from this place once i reached home and unpacked the food it was still fresh 

Coming to the taste Puliogare was spicytangy and good to taste Ambvode was not hard but good to taste it was fried in oil but it was not too oily

7106,Eat Repeat,5,"This place is as authentic as it can be Its also very hygienic The staff are friendly and welcoming

Thanks to the restaurant to keep the authenticity and tradition of local cuisine alive"

7109,Salut,5,The finger food is great and the yellow lit ambience is very calming The rooftop according to me is the best place to dine in The service is pretty fast with reasonable portions
7110,Salut,3,"I had been been to Salut on a Saturday night with a friend The place was packed with only fee tables unoccupied
I checked out all the floors and found the rooftop as the best place to settle in

Salut is one of the best options available around to chill Its located near Jayanagar 4th block and is spread across three floors

Salut offers a variety of food and beverages but lack options for vegetarians

We ordered few beers along with peri peri french fries and pizza
The pizza could have been a lot better

Recommended for its ambience Will add more shortly
Cheers"
7111,Salut,4,Had been there to have quick bites with some beer The ambience is nice with well lit yellow lights The service is these best part  Also this place is attached to a mangalorean style restaurant hence the menu is predominantly based on Mangalore cuisine They have very limited number of starters Pizzas are great though  And post 730 they have an in house dj who plays good music
7112,Salut,4,Was really impressed with the ambiance They have a large display screen and the vertical garden concept is very good Food is great Drinks are little over priced Try out this place if youre in and around south Bangalore

2 Penne Alfredo
Delicious Both the pasta and sauce were cooked to perfection Again the quantity was worth the price Definitely give this dish a try

Drinks
Virgin Mojito and Kingfisher Beer Tower

Salut means hi in French but also is a term used while drinking similar to cheers This restaurant embodies the word Salut The restaurant has alot of greenery which gives the whole place an outdoors and fresh vide It feels like an escape from the city when its in fact situated in the middle of Jayanagar The drinks and food is really good The pesto pizza and the wings are a perfect accompaniment for the beer and drinks Its a great place for a night out or just for a lazy Sunday Thier brownie is also delicious

I rate this restaurant a 810"
7116,Salut,4,"1st what I liked about this restaurant is their ambience and its a rooftop restaurant
Tried the cocktails daiquiri and Long Island ice tea both were perfect to taste
Had the corn cheese bites which was yummy too served with mayonnaise dip
And at last had the pesto pizza which was good with lots of veggies Although the slices were very thin we couldnt finish it fully
Would love to drop in again and try out the other items on the menu"
7117,Salut,1,"SO LOUD
Theres not even a dancefloor but the DJ plays loud obnoxious music in the dining area Its so loud one cant even hear the people at the same table The place is also uncomfortably small to be so loud We requested the staff to have the volume lowered but they flatly refused We couldnt even go through with placing the order"
7118,Salut,3,"We landed up at Salut this evening at 630pm for a quick swig The place is done up in the usual way of bars and pubs bang in the middle of Jayanagar 4th block Unfortunately there is a lot of incoming noise of the prevalent traffic

Only one other table was occupied We ordered a couple of beers salted peanuts and chicken strips They got the order wrong and got the chips instead Once the correct order came it was spicy contrary to what we had requested The chicken strips were tasty though The service in general seemed very mediocre

All in all it was an okay experience Will I go there again Maybe not I would definitely recommend they offer better service and attention to detail for the future"

this place is perfect for college goers and friends to catch up

on the flip side place is pretty packed all the times and tough to find a parking spot also roads are pretty narrow this might make this place for one to think before they choose

and regarding the pricing it hardly burns up to 150300 per person for trying 6 dishes "

Sandwich burgers chats maggie twisters Waffles Ice creams and lot more
We tried paneer maggie chats sandwich mushroom roll and waffle
The panner dint seem fresh at all either was not good or undercooked Even the veggies in the roll were not fresh at all Dint like it much

7546,Big Mishra Pedha,1,"Unreasonable

Had been here for our evening snacks I took a vada pav and sev puri Vada pav was average but the sev puri was a disaster The puri used for the sev puri was the pani puri hollow puri when I checked this with the chaat maker he says that I had to order for Bombay shev puri if I wanted the flat puris Well its your responsibility to let the customers know what each chaat menu has in it Anyway never again"

Has few Mexican options as well The pricing is really impressive and even quantity is overwhelming
Lack of seating  not accepting card on the day I visited is my only complaint
They serve food in disposable organic plates Which is good  environment friendly

The Mexican rice was more like Chinese fried rice
The nachos  bean rice was decent but the nachos were soggy instead of being crispy
Dragon choupsey was great"

So we ordered 3 noodles 1fried rice and 2panner chilli and 1 black pepper gravy The quantity was really less and not tasteful at all
I ordered from Zomato and somehow they did not get the order and I had to reorder on the call
The food was not worth the wait and was too expensive according to the Quantity Paneer was not panner but rubber and there was no difference in taste of panner chilli gravy and black pepper gravy"
7643,Food Springs,4,Ordered hyderabadi biryani honey chilli potato hakka noodles Honey chilli potato was really yummy Noodles also tasted really good Hyderabadi biryani was also nice but in comparison didnt stand out
7644,Food Springs,2.5,"The pricing issue here is that for the money we pay we get a very mearge quantity with Alo paying gst in a roadside shack
Either the price should be reduced or quantity should be increased
The food was good we can give the food a 35
I had ordered a tandoori mushroom rice and the mushrooms were not fried properly The staff is also a bit rude"
7645,Food Springs,4,"Stopped by for some snacks 
Spring roll was very filling  very well made  not too oily served wit a yummy hot and sweet sauce
Honey chili potato was yummmm too
They have soda pops that cost 70rs and they only serve 12 a glass for some reason  Not worth it at all 
The option for drinks is very less  nothing that I wanted to order 
They took very long to prepare  They claim that everything is freshly made  but for a local fast food option they take way toooo much time to prepare"
7646,Food Springs,1,The place isnt like how it is here There is no freaking seat here to sit After starving a while searching for it it totally disappointed is like shit The food in the menu seemed yumm But never mind about the actual food And the minimum rating was one  or I would have given 0

The Honey Chilli Potato was a bit too sweet for my taste while the Rice was flavorful and thankfully not sticking to each other making clumps The Gobi Manchurian was pretty run of the mill though

The food is spiced adequately and the service is warm and welcomingThe only con is that the place is somewhat difficult to locate the first time

I tried the fried rice and shezwan fried riceboth tasted average How ever I would recommend to taste the Gobi manchuri they make its delicious
The quantity they offer for the cost is pretty reasonable Doesnt burn a hole In your pocket
But doesnt fill your tummy too
Overall its a nice place to visit

7792,Food Springs,5,"So it was a holiday and I have started yet again a failed attempt to reduce hence wanted to eat something light not expensive and yet upscaled Found this place on Zomato and decided to give it a try

The one problem I find with every Chinese outlet or restaurant is that you buy 2 dishes and booooooom you end up spending 500 or 1000 in some cases

Food spring a small outlet with a wide range of Chinese and the best part is price and taste Its just awesome more than that its pure veg We had a Hunan wanton soup stir fried green veggies and peri peri mixed rice A three course meal for 2 for just 320

The only issue was there was more salt for first 2 dishes once we notified them they reduced it for the third dish Overall a great place to grab Chinese cuisine on a budget

Taste was ultimate it was with full of fresh mushroom cooked to perfection
Spicy tasty and seasoned

I had paneer pops and spring rolls and both of these dishes were amazing

7899,Goli Vada Pav No. 1,3," A very small outlet located at Gandhibazaar Vadapavs from Golis are my favorites This outlet also serves some good varieties of vada pav

 Ordered Maharaja Vadapav with cheese and Goli fries

 The fries were very crispy and deep fried too oily The quantity of cheese in Vadapav was very less Barely little cheese was spread
I have tasted the Masala Vadapav too its amazingly hot and spicy

 Anyways its worth for the prices though some items are overcharged Takeaway would be preferred Ambience needs to be improved when compared to other Golis outlets There are lot of files in the outlet and not that clean with on overloaded dustbin A 35 rating just for the food"
7900,Goli Vada Pav No. 1,3.5,Very bad service by the staff they are too lazy and they dont make an effort to make vada Pav Vada PAv tastes ordinary these days Sodas are also not that great
7901,Goli Vada Pav No. 1,4,They are serve good Mumbai style Vada paw  Only I disappointed with they dont warm the paw  But they have a good option and varaity  any way when we got Mumbai Vada pav in Bangalore its great for me I am loving it
7902,Goli Vada Pav No. 1,3.5,goli vada pav was the brand whch every one liked initially  Later they did not maintain their standard as before  The only plus point of this one is they deliver home through zomato delivery and swiggy too  So this has around 66 outlets all over the bangalore  It will be some where near to every body so u can order it online as well  The best part of the vada pav here is the big size of pav and different types of vada which we get over here  But anyways this is not the original vada pav wat we get as a perfect maharastrian cuisine  But this may satisfy your crave for vada pav  Also they make sabudana vada which quite unique and different 
7903,Goli Vada Pav No. 1,4.5,"Well this is the place i started eating vadapavThe vadapavs here are amazing and worth the moneyThey keep starting new things like spring rolls pizzas i hv almost tried everything here You should try the potato wedgesschezwan vada pav and the masala vada pav for the spice lovers nice place should visit if u dont want your pockets to get burnt

7940,Goli Vada Pav No. 1,2.5,Its a small cozy place very much not the taste of vada pav its an blend tweaked pav for the present generation Good menu some of them are worth the pay
7941,Goli Vada Pav No. 1,2,"Its a small shop located in Gandhi bazar
The Vada Pavs feel more like burger than vada Pavs
There are lots of street side shops which serves Vada pav way better than this place and are economical too
The vadas are oily and the veg vada pav which barely has any vegetables other than potato"
7942,Goli Vada Pav No. 1,2,Their shezwan vada pav is inediblefeels yukky and toxic
7943,Ragoo's,4,Pizza dinner from Ragoos  pili pili pizza Tasty pizza and the crust was good too Only pain point was the pricing regular 4 slice pizza was 300rs
7944,Ragoo's,4,Luv wid pizzas in this placevisited this place many times  Tried almost all pizzas in menu wit deep pan u can even coustimise pizzas here  Polite staff  Fast service
7945,Pure & Natural,3,"Have been there for lunch Its a small cafe and have some good healthy menu

We have ordered following

Mexican salad which had corn kidney beans and some chopped onion tomato with nachos and dressing I will give  marks for the taste for the salad

Veg soup which was average like a home made soup feel My rating for the soup is 

Pink pasta it was cooked in tomato sauce and was average in taste

Chilli cheese sandwich they served 4 pieces and sandwich was very good Rating 

Fresh juices  

Overall it was a good experience but they can improve on the ambience"
7946,Pure & Natural,3,"Pure  Natural an eat out at Jayanagar one of the cafe with healthy eating options The location of the cafecrowdinteriors and seating is good and interests us too
I have visited pure n natural several times I like their noodles hot salad the best This time we tried veggie salad unfortunately they served without one ingredient mentioned in the descriptionpaneer was missing When asked the in charge very casually saidthey would have missed it taste Will not changedo you really want paneer This response calls for a 3 rating"
7947,Maiyas,1,"We were here on a sunday The time taken to provide seating was 45 minutes which is way too long We opted for Dosa Thali and boy were we disappointed 

The tables are regular granite tables with steep chair Supremely uncomfortable To top it they took almost 25 minutes to serve Being an unlimited thali it was our understanding that dosas were unlimited however we had to literally hail down the waiter and ask him to get us a dosa which were 15th the size of regualr dosa served outside

The thali contained Dal 2 types of chutney 4 variety of dosa pretty forgettable rice sambhar and rasam The sambhar and rasam obviously has color in it and were tasteless 

I would not recommend this place to anyone ever The servers are very good at ignoring you The food served is not hot and overall this is just a waste of our money "
7948,Maiyas,4,Had a nice cup of filter coffee after watching the video from Delhi Food walks Anubhav Sapra Had to stand in a queue just for a Cup of coffee for the first time ever in my life But it was worth the waiting On weekends this place is always crowded in the morning Thanks
7949,Maiyas,4,"I have been to Maiyas few years back and today went for lunch The consistency and quality of food is great The taste of the food is still same
Will definitely recommend this place Service was good The dosa and poori thalis were delicious Will definitely visit again"
7950,Maiyas,3,Tried the North Indian food at maiyas as the South Indian section was crowded The North Indian rotis and curry wasnt that good The staff wasnt interested even in taking order Overall not a good experience and will never try food at Maiyas again
7951,Maiyas,4,"Traditional South Indian Restaurant
I had heard a lot about Maiyas from my friends who stay in and around Jayanagar and got a chance to visit this place recently
The Hotel serves traditional south Indian pure veg food
we tried some of the lunch items and they were simply superb

Must Visit Hotel"
7952,Maiyas,4,"Best known for delicious south Indian food Maiyas located in Jayanagar is a restaurant where many people in the locality prefer this place

Must try 

Masala Sosa
Poori Sagu
Rava idli
Coffee"
7953,Maiyas,3,"We went for a Saturday breakfast We had masala dosaidly vada and kesari bath

Masala dosa and kesari bath was really tasty

We went around 9 but it was not that crowded
Good ambience with reasonable price

If you want to try south Indian food this is one of the place I will suggest but not the best

A family weekend morning breakfast can be planned here

My rating 3510"
7954,Maiyas,5,The quintessential Bangalore eatery which every Bangalorean must visit I tried the special meals section on the 2nd floor and it was impressive The tangy jeera rasam acts as a starter They serve thalis composed of various chutneys and palyasubzi to go with a myriad of mini dosas along with sweets Then its followed by puliyogre and white rice along with raita curds sambhar rasam and papad All this tasty food for only 200 bucks
7955,Maiyas,4,"Had been here for quick snacks Ordered plain dosa as well as coffee

Plain dosa is served with ghee chutney And then the hot coffee in this beautiful weather was very much needed

Ambience is good with decent crowd though crowded Recommended to all bengulurians and nonbenglurians"
7956,Maiyas,4,Keep it simple the right caption for this place Taste of all food served and ambience is good and compliments each other Typical karnataka thalli tasted good n filling for lunch
7957,Maiyas,1,Not really the place one needs to visit for breakfast The dosas are too heavy on the stomach The only good thing about this place is the coffee
7958,Maiyas,4,"Love their Mangalore Bun Bajji and Rava Dosa
Its my all time favorite spot for a snack in the evening or for a quick coffee break with Hitesh Asopa  "
7959,Maiyas,3,"we visited this place on a normal week end afternoon  

We wanted to eat the north Indian food so we headed to top floor restaurant named as dancing Kadhahi 

Place is quite and neat  Seating is comfortable and normal like most of the fine dine restaurants 

We ordered Hara bhara Kababa and Tomato Shorba for starters  Kabab were not good but soup was good 

We ordered makhana and raw Banana curry  Bondi raita and Missi roti for the main course  Curry was new recipe  and it was tasty  Raita was normal  Missi roti was not cooked properly and had some dust from tandoor Looks like they have a broken tandoor 

Overall food was good and staff and service was very good 

Nice place to visit for a quick lunch

Located at busy junction at a walkable distance from Jayanagar metro station

ordinary place with very ordinary food
Waiters are least interested in taking your order and serving food
Quantity is ok
I am sure
You get much better food at better pricing in Darshinis around"
7961,Sip n Dine,4,"One of the good restaurant in vijaynagar with three different segments resto bar  family restaurant and pub
Its good for family dinner and also hangout with friends as very good and comfortable seating
And love the food they serve service is fast and very nice staff friendly place
My love menu here are
Lollipop chicken
Fish tara fry
Prawns ghee roast
Mutton biryani

I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours  Overall I like this place I highly recommend going to Sip n dine

Has cozy sofas and chairs
I really like their neer dosa and chicken ghee roast combination I even like the chicken tikka masala a lot
The staff here is so courteous They treated us really well Service was a little late though
But I felt that the price was a little too much
But Id surely go back to eat the ghee roast "
7963,Sip n Dine,3,"One of the few decent bar cum restaurant in this locality where you could take even your kids along
Ambienceslightly dark on the inside but have a separate family section
Food not too impressed with the food Average serving size and a little pricey
Service Staff is friendly and have parking too which is a bonus
Nothing that will make you go back over and over again Cheers"
7964,Cafe Mondo,3,Ambience of this place is simple but it has some charm Food is okayish Had a pizza and some tea Pizza lacked flavour and the tea was the teabag variety So nothing worth it With cafes like this you atleast expect the food to be good so the people come back Food and quality of service needs to be improved
7965,Jalpaan,5,I very rarely give a full score but I really feel this place deserves the high rating We are non vegetarians and normally dont venture into pure vegetarian places This time however we thought wed give it a try Must say we were pleasantly surprised Starting from the beautiful ambience when we stepped in to the service by the servers everything was perfect Didnt miss the non veg I would definitely recommend the big nacho which was very different from anything we have tried at other places The paneer dish also was very good All this for a reasonable price Very satisfied and would definitely visit here again
7966,Jalpaan,5,"Very good food
Ambience is also very good
Staff is very prompt and helpful
Located in JayanagarDefintetly a must visitTheir biryani was very flavourful"
7967,Jalpaan,4,"A very good family restaurant with decent veg food in jayanagar Food is amazing with a wide variety of dishes and ambience is cool as well We tried thili babycorn paneer chilli tikka fondue margarita and few other dishes Rasmalai was just prefect which just melts in your mouth Chocolate jamoon was unique with chocolate oozing out from jamoon
And finally ended the meal with pan shotsFondue margarita is one of my favorite Love it there Do visit to spend a good time with family and friends"
7968,Jalpaan,4,"Another pure veg hotel you will find in Jayanagar even though the rates are on higher side It is worth trying for veg lovers
There are a few must tries in this hotel
 Papdi pizza
 Pineapple Shorbha
 Bhatti ka panner
 Birbal ki khicdhi
 Potli biryani

Free pan shots is a Must Must try 

These are some unique dishes which you may not in other places

7970,Kataria's Pakwan,1,"Just after eating food stomach got upset and started burping Severe acidity too Didnt eat the paneer subji gravy After 2 hours I checked it was giving foul smell In this cold weather if the subji is made fresh it wont get spoiled minimum 56 hours even if it kept outside So does that mean subji was cooked in day time or the previous day By seeing the subji itself I got to know it was bad Gravy like water and paneer was like stone in that water
Thank you"

7977,Kataria's Pakwan,3.5,This place is good for those who likes a better tasty food Most of the north Indian items are good But the pricing would have been better compare to the ambience This place is good if you want to have the regular lunch or dinner as the ambience is below average
7978,Kataria's Pakwan,3,Had alu paratha once Taste was good Size of the paratha was also sufficient for one person Affordable price Ambience not impressive If you are too hungry while crossing from that road then you can enter there and have something to satisfy your hunger
7979,Kataria's Pakwan,3,"We were hungry and out of the blue I just wanted to eat Gobi Manchuria We thought of trying a new restaurant so we finally decided on this one We ordered Gobi Manchurian Paneer butter masala and Phulka Unfortunately Gobi Manchurian was not cooked properly Although PBM and Phulka was Ok get I was not satisfied

7981,Kataria's Pakwan,3,I ordered online from here The bachelors guide for a wholesome meal for one The mattar panner sabzi is really nice It comes with ajwain paratha which goes really well with it Ordered a separate missi roti which tastes great as well

8021,Kataria's Pakwan,5,"This is the place where you can not expect the service This is a self service restaurant and you need to pay before you eat 
Do not expect the ambiance here The reason I am giving this restaurant rating 5 is because I use to have my dinner here almost daily 
The perfect test of North Indian home made food They have all the meals combo decided and pick one according to your appetite 
Imagine a day you do not want to cook food and still you want to have food taste like home made food then I guess 50 bucks are not a big deal to spend here 
Yes you can have your meal in 50 bucks and that too very tasty and healthy
The people lives in BTM knows the value of it

We ordered

6 phulkas Soft and nice
2 parathas Plain parathas very soft but one of them was a tad bit burnt 
2 Mushroom chilli Yes for me and another mushroom obsessed roommate We requested this chilli dish to be even a level more spicy Was not so great but thats fine Our bad to order this from an authentic punjabi place
Channa Masala Amazingly tasty

The delivery was quick and the bill was very pocket friendly All this came up to 310 I am definitely looking forward for my next ordering in session No prizes for guessing the place

8101,Kataria's Pakwan,3.5,Owned by Katariaji or Kataria uncle as BTM knows them Katarias pakwan specializes in providing ghar ka khana north indian at amazingly reasonable prices Some of their best fare include  Amritrsari thali aloo parathas poha rajma masala etc Dont go here looking for amazing ambience service or fancy fare as they believe in providing quality and tasty food that caters mainly to the studentworking crowd in and around BTM 2nd stage A meal for two costs around 150 which is total VFM The place is small and can seat around 25 and is usually packed 730pm onwards Especially note that they are fantastic for home delivery and food is usually delivered within 20 minutes They also make special arrangements for the eating crowd during festivals fasts etc Most of the crowd that turns up here are regulars who miss home food Definitely worth a check

8104,Kataria's Pakwan,5,its just excellent its lyk home foodand resonabl alsoin a week i atlease order 5or6days lunch and diner
8105,Juicy Momos,3,Couple of nights ago I had the urge to have Momos n upon googling this place came up which is roughly 800m from my home Tried my luck that night To begin with I had paneer Momos n it was good The draw back is u get only 6pcs for 85 The price is on the higher side n the quantity is certainly not enough Then had their Veg schezwan Momos n it was ok ok Nothing great about that They have hot dogs burgers n rolls too I havent tried that yet Will do some other day Staff guys are polite They have flavors that are confusing enough No other issues other than the pricing n quantity provided Need to work on that If the management is serious then they will have to think through this
8106,Juicy Momos,1,"It was a real bad experience
Thanks to swiggy I got some refund

I had ordered chicken steamed fried n Szechuan The steamed momo were stale n brown in colour while the filling was stinking bad

Ruined my momo experience"
8107,Juicy Momos,4,I have been visiting this place for over 2 years and they make good momos and Paneer Pan fried momos is one of my favorites but Ambience is not so good
8108,Amande Patisserie,5,"These tiny Macarons are too yum Specially I liked 2 of it  pistachio and chocolate flavour
And in passion fruit Macaron the centre cream layer had but of tangy flavour which I liked the most  Since I visited the factory outlet There is nothing to tell about the ambiance But the staff there was so welcoming I would definitely visit back to taste some of the other flavours Which I eyed on orange chocolate and strawberry flavour  But the must try is chocolate and pistachio flavour dont miss"
8109,Amande Patisserie,4,"One Word Review  Fantastic

This place has the best macaroons and eclairs you can get in Bengaluru
They are baked fresh taste fabulous and are beautifully packaged

Their tea cakes Madeleine and Financier are a very good addition

I guess this is a pick up store
Never been there have only ordered online

Overall it was a fantastic experience for me
Have ordered multiple times never once was I disappointed
A no brainer place if you are looking French pastries confectionary and deserts"
8110,Amande Patisserie,5,"After reading a lot of reviews about this place we wanted to try it out The location was a little difficult to find out The maps shows the accurate location even then it is easy to miss This is not a cafe it is a factory outlet which is situated on the 1st floor Ordered 4 macaroons rose Belgian chocolate hazelnut and vanilla They all tasted really delicious They had packed it very neatly in a cute little box with ribbon It is pretty expensive I paid 294 for 4 macaroons inclusive of taxes

epicuresdelightblogspotcom"
8111,Amande Patisserie,4,One of the tastiest macaroons in the city  since their macaroons are made of almonds I have thought that it is a cafe but after visiting only I came to know that its their factory  But other than that the orders taken and the staff behaviour is good 
8112,Anand Sweets and Savouries,4,"Tried Motichoor laddo and gulab jamun 
Taste  45
Both the items were great and yumm
Ambience  4
If you are a sweet tooth  you should definitely try this place"
8113,Chicken Hunt,1,"Really upset with the quality of biryani I got lumps of masala
Seemed like they didnt had food to pack as I ordered late yet the order got confirmed

"
8114,Chicken Hunt,3,I orderd a veg noodles mushroom fried rice and veg fried rice from this resturent Delivery was on time packing is also good when i started having noodles it i feel like oily but i thought yeah little bit oil needs to make it but i turned it into different utensil The oil is floating like water and then i didnt had a single bite also Just the oil was problm The other two items veg and mushroom fried rice was good So i rate it as 3 star
8115,Chicken Hunt,2,taste was not good
8116,Chicken Hunt,1,Very bad experience in chicken hunt and not gud taste n quality dont order in this restorunti ordered lemon bone less chicken but he sent bone chicken after that no response from resturent
8117,Chicken Hunt,2,"Checking wid d reviews I thought dt d food would be good  But I was really disappointed wid d quality of d food wch was served to me
I really hope that thy improve their food quality "
8118,Chicken Hunt,4,"Have been a regular visitor here since many years and I have been disappointed only once in all these yearsthe gravy dishes were a bit too spicy on that particular day However that was a very long time back and I have had no issues ever since Love their dry items and roast chicken Their schezwan chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian are really goodFair warning schezwan fried rices are bit on the spicier side so might not be liked by all  They have not had home delivery service for a very long time but have started recently which is why I give them an extra 05for convenience  Ambience is not good However great value for money
The quality had gone down in the middle but off late the taste is back to its original glory Wanted to rate it a 35 but rounding off to 4"
8119,Chicken Hunt,2.5,"The Kababs  Grill chicken here are good

Butseating is an issueThis restaurant is on 100 ft road with open kitchen

i doubt that food served isnt hygenic"
8120,Chicken Hunt,3,It has a Dabha kind of look  Ive been here many times Biriyani is not tasteless Only thing worth trying is chicken tandoori and Kalmi Other than that  nothing is great about this place 
8121,Chicken Hunt,3,"Hold on to your hat folks Im still a vegetarian and yeah I did dine here Was just strolling around the area and just dropped in to see if I could have a bite Turns out they do have some vegetarian options

There was a bit of a crowd since it was a Sunday night I felt quite awkward when I ordered a veg Biryani since this place is so focussed on nonvegetarian food There are very few tables here which is a bummer

I got my Biryanai and for just 75 the quantity was REALLY large Great value for money to be honest In fact I could only consume around 60 of it in spite of being famished The quality was above average but nothing great The place could do with more seating though

Food  35
Ambiance  25
Service  355
Value for money  455
Hygiene  255
Overall  35"
8122,Chicken Hunt,3,Horrible food Only tandoori chicken is worth it for the price All other items have too much colour or rather tasteless I would recommend going there only on a tight budget and you want chicken desperately
8123,Chicken Hunt,1,Chicken huntttttt chucken huntttttt from so many days I was planing to be there but finally to day I went there nice place but for less price we can have food but not good food not so good also bad
8124,Chicken Hunt,4.5,Truly the best restaurant to have tandoori items Ambience isnt that great as its a self service restaurant But nothing beats their food quality and quantity at this reasonable price I would say take away from this restaurant is the best option
8125,Chicken Hunt,3,It was good with dhaba style Afternoon time it was kinda hot because of open area Its little hard to hunt the place I rate it 25 out of 5 
8126,Chicken Hunt,4.5,"I am a regular here and not even once have I been disapointed with their food
Dont expect much on the ambiance It is a very simple self service joint The rating I have given is solely for their food Their prices are very affordable and is completely student friendly
The only one thing that lacks in this place is home delivery They mention free home delivery but not once have I got to talk to them over the phone They never pick up Management I hope you look into this matter
I recommend some of my favorties mentioned below 
the chicken dum biryani
north Indian dishes both breads and gravy
triple fried rice
chicken friend rice
tandoori chicken"

And vegetarian dishes is prepared on the same utensils which they use for making nonveg dishes  Yeah name is chicken hunt As my wife is pure vegetarian i took her once and asked them for veg dishes They prepared with same oilutensils which they were not supposed to

8158,Swadesh Tadka,2,A quaint familyfriendly vegetarian establishment Too bad they take really long to serve you The taste has been wearing off over the years but they try I guess They better buck up to stay in business
8159,Swadesh Tadka,3,"Ordered from this restaurant for home delivery few weeks back  They had some special offer of dinner at Rs 99 going on 

I ordered a Swadesh tadka special biryani combo 

1 Veg biryani  The biryani surprisingly tasted good  It had good flavour and it was spicy  The biryani was still hot when it delivered so it tasted even better  The rice was cooked well  There peas and some other finely diced vegetables and leaves in it  I really liked it  The quantity was very good for the price  It went really well with the raita they provided 

2 Gulab jamun  The Gulab jamun was your typical restaurant style  it was slightly towards hard rather than soft but the taste was still good  the sweet syrup also tasted well 

Overall pretty impressed  the packing was good  the food was good the price was good 

My rating is 35"
8160,Swadesh Tadka,5,Ordered the paneer combo 100 3 chapatis veg biryani and paneer curry A very filling meal at best price Tasty food Really loved the paneer curry
8161,Cane-O-La,4,If you love sugarcane and dont want to catch an infection fear about germs and hygiene then head to thus place  Clean variety of flavours in cane juice itself Worth trying
8162,Cane-O-La,4,Cane juice over here is amazing The have flavours to chose fromcan ask for more addition of flavoursthe place is decent enough and the way its made is clean
8163,Cane-O-La,3.5,"I love the popcorn here Especially the fact that a packet is only 15 bucks
I usually buy 2 to 3 packs whenever I pass by  Keep in my room
Juices are not the best But good enough to beat the heat"
8164,Cane-O-La,4,"This outlet of CaneOLa is located on the bull temple road Its a very small outlet but they havent compromised on hygiene and cleanliness The preparation and serving are neat and tidy Sugarcanes are stored in appropriate conditions The staff is friendly and quick The place is limited to serving freshly made sugarcane juice in an affordable price If you want to drink healthy juice without burning a hole in your pocket this is definitely a place to visit

myhungertaleswordpresscom"
8165,Cane-O-La,3.5,The popular place serves cane juice that is kind of obvious after knowing the name The place is serves different types juice and sticks to its cane juice thingy The best part is they dont use any plastic items not even straws
8166,Cane-O-La,4,What can I write in a review for this Just go take a sip of this ideal refreshing drink this summer  immediately feel the difference Last evening I was again walking past my favorite watering hole when I decided to go in  have just I mug But it was so tasty  refreshing that I had another one I usually prefer the natural flavor but this time I had the ginger as well as the mint flavor I just hope that these guys start using their gloves once again when they extract the sugarcane juice They used to use the gloves in the beginning but now they have abandoned it completelyYes I will be back to down a mug or two but only is they start using gloves once again
8167,Cane-O-La,4,"One of the first cane juice outlets I guess Its on the main bull temple road two or three shops after Subway Pretty easy to locate
Its a very small shop serving some good and hygienic cane juice We can Atleast be sure of it rather than drinking from the street guys
I love their natural and masala flavours My parents however swear by Ginger flavour all the time
Its a nice healthy and fresh juice
I usually end up taking parcels they do a good spillfree packaging

Now that Sankranthi is round the corner its a great time to gorge on some cane juices Their Jayanagar outlet next to Cool Joint is good as well 


knowfoodknowmewordpresscom"
8168,Cane-O-La,4,Who doesnt like a huge bottle of chilled sugarcane juice on a hot day Nothing more to be said One of the best places to drink sugarcane juice right out of the cane itself Times when I used to visit cane o LA In basavanagudi I used to gorge on 4 glasses at one time Its a few yards from the dominos near base tutorials Give it a try
8169,Cane-O-La,4,As fellow foodies have already stated  this branch of caneOla is one of the first to have launched in Bangalore  This branch is Located on bull temple road serves fresh  hygiene sugarcane juice in flavours like lemongingersalt and pepper chat masala apart from the natural all priced at Rs 15 
8170,Cane-O-La,4,"In my very first visit to this CaneOLa outlet I felt a difference in taste of Sugarcane juice The essence of Raw Sugarcane preserved so well I just loved it I have tried other variety like mint ginger chat masala  lemon But still natural flavor stands above all

They use to sell quality chikkis before but unfortunately they stopped it

Just enjoy the naturalness of sugarcane juice with slow sips You feel refreshed in minutes

beingbakasuracom"
8171,Cane-O-La,3.5,One of the first cane outlets in Bangalore and the most authentic Used to be adda for me and for my friends during engg You also get the best pop corn here for just 15 bucks

8173,Cane-O-La,3.5,"One of the very first outlets of CaneOLa  Never been a fan of sugarcane but yet the juice  At a very affordable rate has surely made way into peoples hearts Located in the busy Bull Temple Road just before the signal this place is always bustling with people A healthy choice over the other Juice outlets

I would be glad if they introduce some snacks too"
8174,Cane-O-La,4,"This use to be my frequently visiting Cane juice shop at Basavanagudi Nothing special about the taste but we will get different options like Lime pepper mint and ginger flavored cane juices They have introduced Groundnut and cashewnut Chikkis but it was not up to the mark Price is affordable and Value for money They have so many outlets in Bangalore

8184,Upahara Darshini,4,The place serves very delicious food in addition to South Indian cuisine the vada pav and pav bhajji was surprisingly very very tasty Its a must try That said the place is very small and usually you would end up having to wait for at least 10mins during peak hours

ORDER TASTE AND QUALITY
We had ordered Masala Papad Filter Coffee Chilli Paneer Masala Malai Kofta Palak Paneer Garlic Naan Gulab Jamun and Ice Cream

All the food items were delicious and cook the way they are supposed to be except the Malai Kofta which was not authentic and not good The Gulab Jamun was also not upto the mark

Maybe I had very high expectations but the place is well maintained and pocket friendly"

8192,Karnataka Bhel House,3,Nothing too special to say about the place Looks neat and tidy but a bit cramped for space Its a standing only restaurant with many chaat options Tried the bhel puri which I felt was pre prepared since the bhel was soft and did not pack a punch The dahi puri was nice Sev puri was a bit too spicy for my liking and the Pani Puri sweet sauce had a chocolatey flavour to it which I personally dont prefer The cut fruits were nice and fresh and also I had a chocolate ice cream cone which we all know how it is  Overall not a place to bust your brains out about

8479,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,1.5,Pathetic Biriyani I was more boiled rice n chicken together with some turmeric My rating is for Gobi Manchurian else it cud hav been in minus for Biriyani if the rating systemallowed to
8480,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,2.5,Not so good Masalas were very badMaybe i have a north indian tastebut still the chicken was old or rather stale Too much rice with less chickenand overpriced also
8481,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,2.5,Biriyani is average  chicken tandoori was really bad Good quality  nice place to hangout and chat with some chicken  Reasonable price Good service
8482,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,3,Average biryani nothing great about it what is worth a try is their grill chicken not much competition around if you are in that locality and wouldnt fancy to drive around this place would do good
8483,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,4,After moving to Bangalore recently Bunts was the first place I tried Biriyani from I absolutely loved the chicken biriyani it is different milder than usual but I kinda liked it a lot We tried couple of other dishes from there such as the Manchurian and Naan it was good but nothing special Then we had the grilled chicken leg once that was yummilicious I would return for the biriyani and grilled chicken for sure

8494,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,1,I visited this place recently experience is very bad first of all they dont know how to cook biriyani They use very poor quality rice in biriyani the taste is too bad We asked for starter chicken 65 that was again pathetic I will never recommend this place to anyone
8495,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,5,Nice one in surrounding areas Leg roast is one of my favorite Golden dry is also must taste Biriyani is good compared to the other restaurants nearby Try in once
8496,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,3.5,Speciality is seafood tat too neerdosa n mangalore chicken curry or fish curry Rest all are just menu fillers I had mutton biryani too It was gud Serve chilled soft drinks in summer atleast
8497,Bunt's Biriyani Palace,2.5,Chilli chicken seems like the best bet here biryani doesnt measure up despite being proudly suffixed on the name Others in the cast include some Mangalorean specials almost always tweaked with new age quasi Chinese sauces that render the flavours quite overwhelming Mostly a takeaway unless u dont mind wolfing Biryani and kabab standing darshini style by a busy road Cheap and student friendly

After the wait expected the tea to be good at least But the tea was too dilute and just warm which became cold in no time Didnt expect this from chai point 23rs for a cup of tea and was not even closer to a 8rs lemon tea which we get at bakeries

Been to this place on Sunday evening with my friend to have lemon tea But had to wait for 15 minutes since lemons were not there in the store 

After the wait expected the tea to be good at least But the tea was too dilute and just warm which became cold in no time Didnt expect this from chai point 23rs for a cup of tea and was not even closer to a 8rs lemon tea which we get at bakeries

There is no seating space unlike other outlets but its fine for the kind of business they are in You dont mind having chai and snacks standing around
I usually have the Dum chai or Masala Chai or Ginger Chai with biscuit or samosa though I am not big fan of the samosa here
Do try the Banana cake which is not there most of the times and AppleCranberry Ice chai Avoid the shakes at all times

I like the fact that they focus mainly on their primary product ie Chai

8891,Chai Point,3,Very near to my office Service some times is horrible Earlier used to go twice a day Due to slow service and repeated confusing order go rarely there Snacks are good
8892,Chai Point,3.5,Well this is just another chai point outlet located in jayanagar 4th block i m not very fond of ccd kinda places where they overcharges for tea chai point is thus a delite for me though i m nt a big fan of their dum chai i just love their lemon tea and ginger tea snacks items are also good spclly the banana cake Prices are reasonable too
8893,Chai Point,3.5,"Well  a great place for a quick cup of tea with friends and especially if you are not fond of the CCDs and Cuppas The chai they serve is amazing ranging from their Ginger tea Ginger lemon tea OR only lemon tea All are more than worth the price
Dum Chai and Masala Chai are my all time favorites Next time waiting for someone in Jayanagar stuck in rain while passing on a bike dont forget to have a cup of tea  at this outlet"
8894,Chai Point,4.5,What a convenient outlet for the passersby office goers like me to grab a bite in here I loved the two Masala Chai Biscuits packed for 10Rupees This along with a Chaisamosa would actually take care of your lunch Banana walnut cake would also not disappoint you

Best option for a chai if you are in a hurry and dont have the time to sit at a coffee lounge Located on one the busy roads in Jayanagar this place offers you a great variety of hot and cold beverages at a reasonable price My personal favourites are the lemon teas 
May be on a hot afternoon one can try the cold options as well which are averagely priced compared some of fancy ones in the neighborhood"
8896,Chai Point,1,"They serve a bad cup of tea for a restaurant with the name Chai Point

I have seen this chain of hotels  mainly a low priced tea joints all over the city  but never ventured there as I am a coffee drinker

One day while waiting for my friends I decided to have a cup of tea  Ginger Chai

The chai was horrible I just had a sip and walked away to Maiyas for a cup of coffee

Even a roadside bakery will make better tea than this chain"

But since it was delivered home the cake or the mud pie was compressed and mixed with ice cream but taste wise it tasted too good and sophisticated  I didnt like the taste of raisins in it thou  But overall the ice cream was a delightful experience taste wise would love to taste the other range "
8968,Havmor,1,The service is not up to the mark and no value for customers order as I called the vvpuram parlour branch person to enquire availability of ice cream and he said yes but when I went there I was made to wait half an hour for arrival of stock and till then stock did not arriveI am not complaining on the taste of ice cream but the thing that went wrong was the person who told stock is available but after going there stock was not yet arrived and I sincerely request them not to tell lies and make business cheap We at the corporate level will never entertain these things and instead ignore to getin to such shops Make sure these doesnt repeat again
8969,Havmor,5,Life is like an ice cream enjoy it before it melts   my partner shanujain462 lets go soon for ice cream date  best ice cream every tasted

Its one of the place to have full fledged Veg buffet Nice place to go with the family

We have been there on 1st of jan for lunch We have waited for an hour to get a table

Grill was not done properly for many of the items May be because of the crowd

We liked the desert spread also Overall we had a great time"

Reducing 1 star for this factor only

The place is very spaciousThe service is very goodThis is a must be place for a strict vegetarian as there lots of items for them when compared to bbq nation and other similar places
Howevwrstill a little tough for a hardcode nonvegetarian like me p
They have a very vast spread of items ie 45 vegetarian starterslive pasta  chat counters78 types of dessertsveg biriyaninoodlesricesambarpaneer curry etc

9052,Subz,4,Its a veg only paradise Have been here for multiple family function celebrated here The best part of this restaurant is range of sweets like jalebi which is perfectly baked I liked paneer tikkait is always there dal makhan veg jal frezi mushrooms all good I liked their mouth fresheners after paying bill  They are good but they should get newer dishes in their menu to bring old customers again and again
9053,Cafe Shuffle,1,Horrible Not even kidding We ordered BBQ chicken wings and chefs special pizza They gave undercooked chicken wings and the sauce on it was not even BBQ sauce It was some local sauce with little spices in it Pizza hardly had toppings on it Staffs were so irresponsible We had to tell them to give us the plates and cups after waiting for so long time  Also food delivery is so late You order it now you get it literally half an hour late
9054,Cafe Shuffle,4,While this place is more common for hookah most of the food menu is good as well We tried the Jalapeo cheese balls Veg Lasagne chicken tikka pizza fish fingers The pizza and lasagne were good other dishes were pretty average Its a pocket friendly place with nice ambience and loud music The service is good too Overall nice place for hanging out with friends
9055,Cafe Shuffle,4,Ordered in from the cafe so cant say much about the ambience the food however was good Loved the chicken lasagna which was spicy and flavourful Had also ordered fish fingers but found those only okay It lacked the fishy flavor and tasted like normal fried chicken fingers Will probably visit here soon to be able to give a better detailed review Would give it a 35 but the restaurant gets the benefit of a 4 because of the 5 point scale
9056,Cafe Shuffle,5,"This place is nicei love the Ambiencethe manager is a sweet personhe saw to it that we were well treatedwe ordered hookah with ice base and the manager gave their special flavour which was goodwe then ordered mushroom Manchurian which was amazing ntg could match the taste of itthe crowd was also great I would surely go to this place again

We ordered tomato soup veg manchow gobi manchuri paneer pahadi tikka masala papad dilkush kofta paneer tikka masala dal makhni roti naan paneer peshawari kulcha veg biryani

Paneer kulcha was a rip off 140 bucks Could have been priced 90 Gobi Manchuri was crispy and good Gravies were hot and kofta was soft Garlic naan had pungent taste of garlic which was a put off Biryani portion size can be relooked

staff was very courteous and professional service was great and food was tasting pretty good

ordered roasted papad and veg manchow soup
both were tasting pretty good

and as part of starters we had ordered gobi angare and crispy vegetables
even though gobi was little over boiled the blend applied to it was tasting good and same the case with crispy veg

then we had chosen laccha parata and missi roti
laccha parata was just okay and when it came to missi roti it was tasting pretty plain without any salt

later figured out this was supposed to be prepared in the same way

over all it was a nice dining experience "

9070,Chinese Square,5,Ordered Veg shezwan noodles and dear god it was actually spicy Pretty good quantity for the price and its tasty as well Quick delivery Lemon and mint juice was a little too sweet Savior hunger pangs which is close to my abode 
9071,Chinese Square,4,"I happened bro visit this place by chance Thanks to rain that I stopped at this place and also had food in here I had manchow soup baby corn manchuria and schezwan fried rice All this had great taste Manchow soup did taste very good may be because I was drenched in rain But no doubt this place serves tasty food
The thing I like about this place is the type of plate food is served in It is very handy

9082,Punjabi Raswada,3,Had the thali here  the taste was good and the amount of items were not many They can be more competitive and refine the taste  Cause the items on the menu are carefully picked and a good choice the taste can be better The ambience was quite and bright as there was only one other table full All in all a fine lunch experience

Must Try  None

Clue  Had ordered egg whites omelette which was super oily and charged 60  extra for making it with only whites Also had a cold coffee which was too sweet Had a brownie too which was so average Outdoor seating decor is good but infested with mosquitoes The owner who sits near the entrance was frowning as I was trying to greet the super cute Shihtsu doggies lying down at the entrance Im really not sure how and who gives this place high ratings"
9085,Vinny's,3,"Food  Drink  Pizzas and pastas And some deserts A few soft drinks too Simple menu Simple pizzas presented in a very non pretentious fashion Thin crust is good Tastes good Margarita pizza was a tad bland Sun dried tomatoes were out of stock Overall not a bad pizza place for a quick bite

Price  Priced well Good value quotient Wont terribly pinch your pockets

Service  Very friendly staff Orders taken fast Food is delivered fairly quickly

Ambience  Indoor and outdoor seating Covered outdoor space is well laid out Again simple interiors and nothing fancy

Location  Opposite to Banashankari BDA complex

Parking  Street Or in the BDA complex

Speciality  Pizzas and pastas

Must try  Nah

Pro tip  Pick nice veggies as toppings for your pizzas Obviously youd say"
9086,Vinny's,3,"I had plans to visit this restaurant ever since Zomato promoted with Vinnys video and felt it does not deserve all the hype

We went ahead with Onion Rings Thin crust pizza slice Alfredo sauce pasta and Red Velvet cake While pasta and onion rings tasted good pizza and cake were a disappointment They were just average and the cake was dry Top of it slow service and we had asked for items we ordered on a sparsely occupied weekday afternoon Pups and dogs were not responsive at all So if you are planning to visit due to the pets  You better avoid it 3 for pasta and onion rings I may not visit again"
9087,Vinny's,4,Went here for lunch and found this place quite peaceful to sit with friends Pizza which we ordered was great This place offers you varieties of Continental and you can even go for slice if you dont prefer 12 pizza Go for this place if you want fire wood  Food and ambience is good
9088,Vinny's,5,Been here a lot of times and the consistency of the food and service is pretty remarkable Never really had a bad experience Its known for Italian food especially pizzas and they taste really good One of the few places that serve pizza by the slice as well The prices are very reasonable The service is good too
9089,Vinny's,3,"Have been wanted to visit this place from long time Finally visited this place which is located in Banashankari 2nd stage opposite to BDA complex
As soon as you enter this place you can just smell the aroma of pizza which will make your stomach crave for eating
The place has many seatings You will have outdoor seating as well as indoor seatings On some days you can find cute little shihutzu dogs walking around you which brings joy on your face
Well coming to the food
Ordered
1 Mozzarella sticks which was very hot and cheesy cheesy and was really yummy which was served with a chilly sauce
2 Alferdo veg pasta was quite sour and quantity was less Taste was not as expected
3 Paneer Tikka thin crust pizza was hot and creamy with pieces of paneer and dew vegetables on it Taste was quite good
4 Caramel custard dessert must try dessert in this place The dessert was really soft abd mouthwatering

Service was really good and quick"

9091,Vinny's,4,"My first visit to Vinnys can be summed up as a good one we were full before entering the place and were basically looking to kill time Ended up ordering the BBQ chicken pizza and the Margherita pizza both slices the thin crust makes it feel lite on the tummy and the chicken was replicating the BBQ feeling to the fullest
We also tried the Caramel custard and loved it too it was fresh and was nicely done
Next up would be to come here on a weekend and try a full sized pizzas

Coming to the food part we had the Roasted Chicken pizza which was pretty decent but not something too woo about Whereas the woo factor came in to play big time when we were served the Alfredo Chicken pastaspaghetti The sauce was absolutely blissfull creamy and cheesy The spaghetti was cooked to perfection and the chicken inside the pasta was also pretty tasteful For washing this down we had the Butterscotch Punch and the Mango delight 

Overall the experience was one to remember and I definitely would jump on another chance to go here"
9102,Vinny's,5,"This place packs a punch both with its ambiance and food The place gives you a calm feeling which can relieve your tension

Coming to food they provide pizzas in slices as well which is a quarter of the 12 inch pizza I dont like thin crust pizzas but this one was really worth a try Everything was in right proportion be it cheese or toppings

Next we tried lasagne which was good in taste but to be honest I have had better ones at other places It had too much tomato flavor My advice will be to go for some pasta instead of lasagne

Mozarrela cheese sticks is an awesome innovation by Vinnys and is a must try

Last but not the least we tried Tiramisu and Banofee Pie in desserts Tiramisu tasted just like an ordinary pastry and you should definitely give it a pass

Banofee Pie was out of the world and is the best that I have had in Bangalore and Delhi combined

Would have been much better
Would expect to be better at taste next time"
9140,Chetty's Corner,1,Ordered online and received it on time but the quantity was not at all as expected for the amount paid Absolutely disappointed with the service Never again ordering from this place  one of the worst
9141,Chetty's Corner,4,Snacks at affordable prices Quantity is value for the price we pay Might get a bit late during evenings Twisty potato is one of the all time favourites
9142,Chetty's Corner,1,Food is horrible Half hearted effort put into the sandwiches Ordered a chilli cheese sandwich among other things and they were stingy on the cheese not so stingy on the chillies Bad combination
9143,Chetty's Corner,3,"A feeling to explore a new unit food and taste took me to this unit Its opposite to masala restaurant not in the corner  though name mentions to be at the corner l

I had two products suggested by the lady
Nippat Masala
Chetty Masala Bhel

they both were good but lacked to attract my taste buds

Overall very good and courteous staff they are helpful
Unit was averagely cleaned could notice spider web on roof

9146,Kapoor's Cafe,3,"We had the veg kabebs which was a little too salty for my liking

The veg kofta was spicy but the veggies were completely mashed which made the kofta very dense

The dry fruit lassi was more like shrikhand and less like lassi but the taste was good

Probably should have tried the batura looked yum

Worth a visit Ambience is good"
9147,Kapoor's Cafe,4,"A pocket friendly pure veg Punjabi restaurant Its a nice place amongst must try places Lassies are the best of all here especially the dry fruit lassi Among the starters the cheese balls were really good but the Punjabi style French fries didnt click that well Was a bit disappointed because they told its going to be spicy but it hardly had any taste to it The best comes to you when u order the paratas Mouth watering ones but too big to finish The onion aloo combination hit it off The dhaba style ambience makes the place interesting and the service was also good The staff were polite and friendly But only problem was that we had ask for cutlery everytime Should try this place in either of their branches

9167,Sukh Sagar,4,Best place to grab a quick breakfast or have a nice meal with family or friends The food is all made fresh and very hygienic They have the self service counter in the groundfloor and seating arrangement for the first floor
9168,S M V Snacks Corner,4,Samosas were crispy and tasty please give correct description Maggi as Maggi dont misguide the customer I was expecting noodles but received Maggi
9169,S M V Snacks Corner,3,when u find food at 50rsa kanjoos mind is eager to try so this was mac n cheese and noodle biriyani which was more maggi biriyani with its maggi taste and place was close so was delivered hot and steaming there is value for money but a one time try for the qty u cud actually buy ready to cook packs
9170,S M V Snacks Corner,5,If it wasnt SMV jain college life would have been incomplete cheese maggi paneer roll oreo milk shake and many more helped us survive at that place and most importantly never expected SMV to be on ZOMATO Do try out at this place
9171,S M V Snacks Corner,3,"SMV wow didnt expect this to be on zomato
anyhow SMV a survival of all the colleges near it from BMS or jain group of institutions SMV helped me survive one whole year of studying and i have eaten of lot of SNACKS here
well they do have
99 types of Dosa
50 types of wrap
around 20 types of maggi
vada pav
and all Pocket Friendly snacks for lunch or after lunch snacks
juices are available as well
my suggestions
cheese maggi
and mosambi juice to get through the evening
but do try some wraps and Dosa they have been lighting up the taste buds to a whole different level
its approximate price will be around 50100rs just for a quick bite
no seats to Sit just order take it away or sit outside and eat quite crowdy during weekdays and during college hours u might have to wait for atleast 20 mins to get your turn for maggie
their are many more items that can be found here but its worth the wait"

9202,San Churro Cafe,3,"Chocolaty and churroic experience

Hit chocolate and churro with chocolate dip in the picture

My first time at this restaurant and it has delivered in service options as well as taste"
9203,San Churro Cafe,4,Though very sadly the place looks in need of retouching but the food was great Especially when it was super cold outside and we were super hungry the staff was nice We ordered the pink pasta and a pizza Both of them were pretty good Was really tempted to try their Churros but we were stuffed Worth a visit and try for sure
9204,San Churro Cafe,3,Churros the restaurants eponymous offering has to be tried Theyre a Mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce Milkshakes are good too The interior walls have murals and writings all over Havent tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good
9205,San Churro Cafe,3,Honestly have only tried parcels and that too only starters and mains  never tried desserts So this review is based on starters and mains only The quality wasnt all that great was pretty average
9206,San Churro Cafe,4,"Visited this place for the first time recently The ambience was pretty good We ordered two churros for two Having churros for the first time ever I was way too excited and judgmental But swear to Lord the churros were heavenly The chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xD We had taken the Cross Country Ranch pizza It was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies
The place is famous for churros the name suggests so I would love to visit again to try all the other items out "
9207,San Churro Cafe,4,"I love the desserts more than anything here Good place and well served 
We dint like the nachos here  it was not that good as we expected 
Except nachos almost all dish were quite good"
9208,San Churro Cafe,2,2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined Churros was hard pizza was pathetic loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO Yes mayonnese Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience pretty slow and inattentive staff Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499 We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other Thatll be my last visit San Churros
9209,Rajathadri Food Fort,4,"Good foodquick servicegood amnience what else do you need in a restaurant I really like the food over her I took a panner manchurianmushroom 65 and a baby corn pepper dry and Malawi kofta with butter kulcha and a lime soda everything tasted really good and I liked it a lotthis is a good place to visit with your family
But the only problem is it is tough to get parking I would definetly recommend this place"
9210,Rajathadri Food Fort,5,"Rajathadri food fort is the Best hotel I ever come across in Bangalore
Best taste
Best ambiance
Reasonable price
It is situated in nice place
Totally loved it"
9211,Rajathadri Food Fort,4,If u stay in Jayanagar and you want to visit a good place for dinner whether you want to have North Indian  South Indian  chats or just pav bhaji I would blindly suggest you rajathadri  They got good food to satisfy ur hunger  No doubt you can take ur friends or family too  They have two sections  A section for self service and if youre lucky u can get a table to sit too or otherwise it doesnt harm to stand at a food table and just eat  They also have service hall  But sometimes you might need to wait 
9212,Rajathadri Food Fort,3,"Being close to where we live we often visit here for coffee and breakfast They have two dining areas one where you go for a quick bite which is a self service area The other is a service area We were 8 of us and went to the service area for lunch on a weekday We got a table immediately The decor is quite simple and nothing commendable The staff were friendly and always smiling
We had masala papad which chatpata and tasty The baby corn Manchurian was crisp and not heavily spiced I did not relish the tomato soup as it was too tangy and oily Then we had rotikulchas paneer butter masala kaju masala and veg kadai The gravys were well made they had flavour and the paneer was nice and soft The kulchas were very rubbery which was disappointing A lot of effort went into finishing those We had curd rice and ended our meal with gajar ka halwa which was well made

The prices are very moderate and the service is good Overall a decent place to dine"
9213,Rajathadri Food Fort,4,"One of good vegetarian restaurant that provides umpteen north indian cuisine options  Had been there with family for Sunday lunch and felt happy for making the right choiceRight from the soup to main course was perfectly Cooked and quantity was great for 7 members  Few dishes was spicy and service is quick

foodpunditbengaluruwordpresscom"
9214,Rajathadri Food Fort,4,Button idly is my choice from the outlet Combination of button idlies dipped in sambar with ghee topping is something which should not be missed
9215,Rajathadri Food Fort,4,"The problem with places like this is that everytime the food tastes different

Had parcelled palak Alu last time and it was the most tastiest veg dish ever And when I tried palak mushroom last week I was breathing fire And they do not know how to do Mangalore bajji What they serve is a insult to the original dish 

On the whole good place for family to sit and enjoy a relaxed time Ambience is good Try the palak marsala dosaits yummy"
9216,Rajathadri Food Fort,2,For breakfast i been here many times here breakfast is too good like  masala dosa rice bath  kichidi  khara bath is very good  as usual coffee and tea well maintained place good service and decent ambience finally I been for lunch we took south and north Indian Thali options are not that great and tastwise also  south Thali was ok ok but north Indian Thalia all items taste like tamarind taste  no vegetables in sabz  veg biryani was not good I liked only Dal very disappointing
9217,Rajathadri Food Fort,3,Overrated place with costly pricing Service a bit late Hot chocolate fudge wasnt hot at all Taste is okay Can try once if no nice eatery is available
9218,Rajathadri Food Fort,3,"Located is tbe centre of Jaynagar Big enough It has service hall as well as fast cood counter Road side Parking Idly and Sambhar was very nice Piping hot yummy Sambhar and good chutney Cheese Dosa was very average Batter had become sour
Hopefully will try again

Cleanliness was maintained well"
9219,Brew Meister,3,"This place is in Jayanagar just opposite to meghnas biryani
In veg starters the dragon panneer is one of the best I have ever hadThe panneer was soft and the sauce was lip smackingThe peri peri fries and egg chilli tasted good
Their signature vegetarian medley pizza topped with broccoli olives and bell peppers was awesome
Their Andhra chilli chicken and their Chicken biryani tasted amazing as per my friends opinion
Their thai Chicken curry tasted pretty average

The Cavalier pilsner is a great brew and has the fruity flavour The best starter dish was the orange chilli chicken  has the regular chilli chicken flavours with a tinge of orange
For the mains the grilled fish with butter garlic sauce and rice is a good one Very mild but full of flavours"
9221,Brew Meister,4,"What an amazing place to be in Jayanagar for good food and freshly brewed beer

The ambience of this place is lively with roof top They have an option to bring down a closeable roof as well in case it rains

The staff is great very warm

They have 4 varieties of freshly brewed beers Pale is what I had it was too class

Their tandoori broccoli and tandoori mushroom was just yummy

Dont miss their missal pav they make it really great"
9222,Brew Meister,4,"What brew cafe

Where jayanagar

Ambience excellent

Finally visited the most talked place in Jayanagar The ambience is excellent and its a roof top restaurant Ordered fish with rice served with butter and lemon which was too yumm The fish melted in the mouth Enjoyed every bit of it and the flavored rice was lip smacking Then came the pork chops which cooked perfectly with perfect blend of spices Also ordered my favorite lamb minched pizza which was thin crust and excellent in taste
Coming to the beer they freshly brewed all beer and my favourite was pale and stout
Yes I would definitely visit this place Jayanagar has its own brewed pub now"
9223,Brew Meister,3,"Mocktails are good
Food ididnt like
Service very slow
Indoor ambience worst
Music selection is good
Overpriced quantity less
Needto improve in nonveg recepies"
9224,Brew Meister,4,"Ambiance
Me and my friends visited this place on an evening
Seating arrangement had a right mix of couches to high bar chairs This place was mostly occupied by family crowd atleast during my visit
I guess because of the location

Beverages
The brewed beers have a little refreshing taste Did not feel water being mixed like few others have mentioned

Food
The peanut masala had a nice tangy taste to match with bitter beer
Fish was nicely cooked Was tender and soft
Tandoor Chicken had the right mix of flavours
Quantity can be a little more for the price paid Just a suggestion
Hummus and pita bread was just ok

Overall
Good option to hang out with friends and family
Little heavy on pocket
Service speed can be improved"
9225,Brew Meister,4,"Nice place and has got good ambience Liked the food except for the chilly Paneer The Paneer was very hard The cocktails and the mocktails are both good Initially I was a little disappointed with their service but later it was fine Overall a good experience and surely try again for more menu

The service is superfast the dishes and the brewed beer were quite good Unlike some of the previous reviews we found the portions to be more than sufficient Will definitely visit again"
9227,Brew Meister,4,A very nice place with very good brew beer  Food is also excellent  Must try their Dal makhani its amazing  Must visit place in South Bangalore 
9228,Brew Meister,4,I went to brewmeister a month after it opened and I thought it was average Surprisingly theyve improved their food over the last few months and have also started brewing their own beer I love their Belgian beer The prices are great and its a go to place for a casual pub night in Jayanagar The bacon wrapped sausages are amazing and you cant find them anywhere else in Jayanagar Do try their butter garlic prawns The short eats are like any other hotel Id love to go again
9229,Brew Meister,4,Its a good place to get some fresh brewed beer One of the frist rooftop breweries in jay nagari really like the ambience at this placethe stout had a good flavourgood service and courtious staffalways brings back to the customeroverall experience was great i would like to visit again

Brew Meister has an ambience where once you enter you forget that youre in the middle of Jayanagar as it has a wide open rooftop space and great interiors which make this place somewhat of a getaway from the usual husstle and bustle of Jayanagar
The interiors are probably the best thing about the restaurant but the food isnt bad either I would suggest the peri peri corn as it is a perfect bar snack The pizza here isnt very good but everything else tasted good and accompanied the beer well
Brew Meister is probably the best bet to get a good beer in Jayanagar They have a great selection of locally brewed beer and the Indian Pale Ale and the stout were actually good and compared to the big more famous breweries around Bangalore The price of the beer is also very reasonable and because of this I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who needs a place to relax and get a drink in Jayanagar

I rate this restaurant 810"

9234,Brew Meister,4,This place is a Multistorey Gastro pubmicro brewery with good ambience and great music Large seating capacity can accommodate large groups with roof top dining as well Stout beer and ale here is good and one of the best LIIT Food is pretty decent Quesadilla was standout Great place to hangout
9235,Brew Meister,3,"Finally Jayanagar has a great microbrewery under its belt Nestled quietly near Jayanagar 4th Block microbrewery has its own charm

The beers are brewed to perfection and guess what its a rooftop
Spread across two floors the upper floor is the preferred one when it comes to seating

I tried the Pilsner and witbier
The pilsner is smooth and fine One of the best pilsner beer I have had Belgian Witbier was good but lacked the essentiality of wheat beer

Coming to food I had a heavy Sunday brunch before crashing at this place so just ordered Dragon Paneer and Corn Peri Peri The Dragon Paneer was decent
The portion size is undoubtedly wasnt right sized for two people The food menu is pretty limited and average Would love to see more options in the menu

Would surely visit this place againmore because I stay nearby and try out more of their food on offer and experience the wonderful ambiance
Cheers"

9293,Brew Meister,1,Trying to be polite hence not going to divulge into too much  this place has potential however its really badly run The staff is scarce and untrained The food was pitiful The beer was subpar Dint like the ambience and approach to the place either Not my kinda hangout
9294,Brew Meister,3,Good place for a family gathering Id say Though I had been here with couple of friends and didnt really feel the vibe much However in case youre around Jayanagar do give it a shot
9295,Brew Meister,4,"I would happily give this place a 5 star rating for its ambience rock music the sit out  food menus  their brewed beer and the location But their service was crazy horrible We got wrong dishes on our table they took forever to serve and for such a huge place the staff was really less and hence the mismanagement Brew Meister is one of those places with a lot of potential especially when its located in an area like jayanagar But due to the lack of a few important aspects is failing to really pick up 
PS You should definitely try their keema paav"
9296,Brew Meister,4,"Pretty cool place to grab a bite As its a brewery took a sampler of their beers I really loved their seasonal variety For food ordered  coriander chicken harissa chicken chicken quesadillas and chicken wings Chicken wings is a must try  loved their barbecue sauce Coriander and harissa chicken were a bit spicy but tasty indeed

9300,Brew Meister,4,"Day 2 in Bengaluru and I couldnt leave without having some beer Brew Meister in Jayanagar looked inviting and dropped by for a quick lunch and some beer guzzling
Its a large and spacious space with a lot of seating JP helped us with our orders
Unfortunately they didnt have the stout that I wanted so I went for my favorite Belgian Wit beer I was impressed with the beer Called only for starters and we went for the pepper mutton and the blazing Naga pork Both the dishes were well cooked and did justice to JPs warning of them being spicy Portions served were generous Spicy food lovers must try them out
Called for a chocolate mousse cake pastry for dessert and it looked so delicious that we gobbled it down without remembering to click a picture so you can take my word for it
Awesome place to visit with friends and have long and fun conversations over beer and food Brew Meister was a fitting conclusion to an excellent weekend full of amazement Thank you"

Sad to say that the quality of food as well Our entire group of 14 people gave average ratings for food Avoid the honey chilli Gobi they gave free replacement as it had more heat than the sun  curd vada tikka nachos as they r just horrible Really disheartening experience"

Ordered Curd Vada Masala Dosa Rava Idli

Curd Vada

Excellent taste but the quantity of Curd provided was less

Masala Dosa

Taste was good however the packaging can be improved a little better

Rava Idli

Taste was good the same was served with Veg Sagu which tasted average

Chutney provided tasted very good"
9330,Ayodhya Upachar,4,Yummy food From tomato soup to noodles to Naan and kaju masala everything was delicious Only the baby corn manchurian was not up to the mark
9331,Ayodhya Upachar,3,Ambience is not that good at this restaurant and not hygienic too Service is too slow and not a pocket friendly restaurant dont ever visit this restaurant
9332,Ayodhya Upachar,4,"Been here once A decent place for veggies staying around banashankari The ambience is not all that great but nice enough to feel comfortable Its strategically located on the main road So if you are around the kathriguppe area and hungry do lay this place a visit Quick service delicious and easy on the pocket too

BTW you could order food from here too using any of these food apps I ordered from here recently Tried capsicum masala kulcha and Gobi Manchurian Here are pictures

But before that my verdict

Food45
Value for money 45"
9333,Ayodhya Upachar,3,Had got food delivered yesterday Ok in terms of delivery speedTaste is medium we ordered kulcha they sent roti Only paneer butter masala was good Curry was saltyDal was good
9334,Ayodhya Upachar,5,I be been here many times for a casual dinner and at times for breakfast too  There are many varieties of dishes the north Indian thali is very good among them
9335,Ayodhya Upachar,4,"Been here for a casual dinner along with my family The place was busy with good crowd and food aggregators occupying the premises
We started off with Gobi Manchurian mushroom chilly and mushroom pepper dry The mushroom chilly was the stand out among the three Gobi was a bit disappointing with uncooked portion while the pepper overpowered the mushroom in the other dish
For the main course it was butter khulcha with paneer butter masala and mushroom masala The khulcha was soft and went well with both the curries which did not have any negatives to it Overall it was satisfying experience here Service needs to improve as things take time to get over the counter
I will definitely recommend this place if you are fine with self service and wait for the food"
9336,Ayodhya Upachar,4,Ordered Chinese combo of veg fried rice and Gobi Manchurian Quantity was good enough for such affordable price Fried rice was nice But the Manchurian was not great could have used little less coating on the Gobi
9337,Ayodhya Upachar,3,I ordered North meal and veg fried rice the North meal was disappointed does not have proper quantity according to the paid amount but the veg fried was meet the requirements
9338,Biriyani Mane,4,Calicut spice biriyani tasty I love it I buy twice time Friday and Sunday I feel same taste this biriyani thats why I buy it again my favorite Mango pickles
9339,Biriyani Mane,3,Nice place to have dinner quality is good and quantity should improve this is my feedback and improve on quantity and quick delivery taste wise good
9340,Biriyani Mane,1,We had taken 4 hyderabad biriyani and one of the bowl had cockroach in it And the biriyani also not tasted well I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone
9341,Biriyani Mane,2,Small place with no seats and chicken biryani tasted very average There are plenty of excellent alternatives near this area if you want to try biryani
9342,Biriyani Mane,5,"Awesome biriyani
Must try Chicken garlic kabab
I just love their biryani Its very very different compared to all the restaurantsoutlets in Bangalore
Biryani rice combined with garlic chicken kabab is a deadly combination Their JP nagar outlet garlic kabab is different compared to Jayanagars which is their first outlet I felt this outlet serve more authentic one compared to their JP nagar outlet near Ragi gudda temple
Over all must try place in Bangalore"
9343,Biriyani Mane,4,"Good food for d price they charge
It would be good if they had place for dinning n more of a family restaurant
Chicken lollipop is good
Chilli chicken is tooooooo good"
9344,Biriyani Mane,3.5,"A tiny little place that is high on taste It has no seating arrangement so its either takeaway or stand and eat table is provided as shown in photos on zomato We ordered for a couple of mutton biryanis and a plate of boneless chicken fry The biryani is more of a pulao but tasted great nonetheless The gravy accompaniment was so awesome that I could have used two of those bowls It was decently priced and whatever they couldnt provide in terms of seating or dine in they more than compensated with a generous amount of pieces The biryani tasted spicy and delicious and the mutton was also cooked perfectly The chicken as well was spicy and hot and we got a good 810 small pieces at least For a satisfying meal this place more than fits the bill They had loads of other starters on display which looked irresistible A definite goto or keep going to place

Note  Parking for 4 wheelers could be a bit of problem during peak hours"
9345,Biriyani Mane,4,"Food  2 Mutton biryanis and a biryani rice All good Delicious and tasty Unfortunately couldnt try any starter
Money  Theyve priced their items reasonably well Not a lot of places serve Mutton biryani at 160 So its good
Place  This is next to the food world on the marketkanakapura road not too far from Banashankari TTMC This place doesnt have a seatable restaurant Its an outlet where u spot ppl relishing their food while standing A better place to take away
Comment  The Biryani rice we took away surprisingly remained hot for a very long time Impressed"
9346,Biriyani Mane,4.5,"IMO Chuck everything else Its the Bangada Masala Fry to crave for 70 Bucks for this damn lil awesome thing What the Fish I think this is the most underrated dish here 

Fresh fish Its perfectly cooked from the inside tamarind mixture with the liberal amount of green chillies on top makes it spicy but yet both of these compliment each other

A bite of it with the masala"
9347,Biriyani Mane,3.5,"A quick service restaurant which serves variety of dishes including Tandoori Roti north indian gravies and limited Chinese   I have been here more than a couple of times and since it is quite close to my residence its my regular joint for a quick bite 

I have had variety of chicken dishes including Kalmi Kabab chilly chicken wings and my biryani  The food is served hot and the starters are good to say the least  Well cooked and the right amount of spice  The meat is generally tender which makes it very good  The Biryani is more like a pulav but good to taste It is served hot which is the way I like it  

Coming to the service the staff is very courteous and friendly and since it is a self service the time taken to serve is less  Pricing is very decent and please note that there in no seating 

Highly recommended"
9348,Biriyani Mane,4,"Biryani maneThe unsung Biryani houseLeast popular amongst the biryani serving destinations I blame it for its ambience There are no seating arrangements All that you find is the planted tables and shelves to accommodate your plates But the food served compensates for all the flaws here The aroma of the biryani kebabstandoors is appetizing The food will exceed your expectations No biryani is as gratifying as this one Moist cooked to perfectionexquisitely seasonedperfect blend of spicesuniqueno exaggerration Kalmi Kababneer dosachicken sukkamasala anjal fish fry and chicken wings are yummiliciousmust try I tell you I have come across many of its branches but I have never visited any of those except for this one

9349,Biriyani Mane,3.5,"Came to know about this place via Zomato I managed to visit this place today
For starter I ordered Chilli Chicken we may alter the level of spiciness as per our wish I told em to make it extra spicy since it was chilli chicken silly haha
I must mention very courteous staff started serving right awayNo seating facility available Chilli Chicken had huge amount of yummy crunchy bell peppers and green chillis just as per my liking
For main course I ordered Chicken Dum Biryani and it was served hot and fresh with 2 pieces of chicken Very satisfying
I will revisit

They also have north indian curries in their menu but it takes a little more time than their usual Biriyani and Rice items

I would recommend not to try Chicken fried rice noodles etc as the chicken pieces were not cooked properly and they were almost raw

9480,Cafe Ajfan,4,It was an amazing sandwhich totally cool place to visit  there is hell a lot of places to visit in Bangalore wanna complete almost all Places there still plenty this is gonna me my favourite one
9481,Cafe Ajfan,3,"Got Zomato Gold 11 on food here
The ambience of the place is nice and comfortable The dishes are decent but nothing to write home about The salad was decent
The bun used for the burgers seemed as if theyre bakery buns which was disappointing"
9482,Cafe Ajfan,3,"Been there for dinnerThe ambiance of restaurant is nice now food we ordered were crispy chicken burger chicken shish tawook wrap and chicken stroganoffall are average not very yummy
Only one lady was there whos doing all work
So naturally the wait time is too muchbut shes doing that with a happy face"
9483,Cafe Ajfan,4,Good food decent ambience with handful menu Soups and Calzone pockets tasted great  Dessert was so fresh Deep fried items were alight Not very spacious but the lightning arrangement will make it special Not to forget their comfortable seating Zomato Gold makes it even special and price is reasonable
9484,Cafe Ajfan,4,"The place has a lovely ambience The sofas are very comfortable and you will not feel like leaving I tried the hot chocolate which was very rich just the way it should be So satisfied about that
Peri peri chicken burger felt more like grilled chicken The buns were too thick and therefore I hope they go for thinner buns with more flavourful chicken The fries looked fresh and crispy so that was great
Coming to the Lebanese delight we chose the one with lamb seek The hummus was okay I felt it had too much tahini but it got better after 34 bites The lamb was very tough I couldnt eat much The pita was perfect
Overall a nice place good service good pricing Just that they should pay attention to finer details of food and itll perfect Would love to visit again"
9485,Cafe Ajfan,3,"Mediterranean style cuisine The ambience is great but could be more spacious The almond saffron soup is a must try Though Ajfan grilled chicken is hyped but looks same as chicken alfaham but here its over priced for half chicken 
Music was good Had some great expectation but was an average place

Hummus  55
Kubboos  55
Fries  55

Whatever dishes Ive tried in all the 4 times Ive been here  455

The food here is just amazing Service might take a while but its worth the wait Having lived in the gulf I can confidently say this place is as close as it gets with arabic food"
9488,Cafe Ajfan,4,The food here is noteworthy and the milkshakes are a must try The chicken was tender and cooked right and veggies as a side along came perfectly The service is a little slow but the ambience is decent
9489,Cafe Ajfan,5,"Loved all the items which we ordered We were damn hungry when we dropped in Its a cute little cafe and its worth the money
Ordered the following items
Herbed rice ordered it for my son n it tasted yummy We could eat it plain without any sides with it
Plain and peri peri fries both were good to taste and it was served with tomato sauce
Mac n cheese pasta it was so very good it melted in our mouth We cleaned d whole bowl within a minute
Onion rings this was a little sweet with the dip provided with it
Grilled peri peri paneer it was d spiciest among the all the items Served with lot of grilled veggies and mashed potatoes
Club sandwich this too was amazingly done
Mexican Poached eggs it was served with toast and Mexican masala It was too good to be forgotten

Would love to visit again"
9490,Cafe Ajfan,4,Must try Ajfan special thickshake without any second thought best dry fruit shake Ive ever had Food taste is good but not that yummy so you can lick your fingers otherwise overall a good experience Ambiance is quite small so youll feel noise when it is full Definitely Ill go for the ajfan special thickshake
9491,Cafe Ajfan,4,I visited this place as they have 11 on Food due to zomato gold When I entered the restaurant two tables were filled as it was pretty early in the afternoon It had a very Arabic smell and appearance The menu looked really good for a place with around 10 tables It had everything from Arabic to steaks I ordered the piri piri paneer steak and lamb steak The paneer steak was really spicy and went great with their sides I personally loved it but I think the portion was very average They couldve increased it by 20 The lamb steak was delicious It was served with an extra cup of pepper sauce and I didnt want to leave even a drop of the sauce It was really good Portion however was less He mash potato was just like how anyone would love it Creamy few chunks and perfectly done lamb I would recommend anyone to try out this place and have their lamb steak Value for money
9492,Cafe Ajfan,4,The food was good The taste of nachos was just wow crispy corn fritters was not crispy but it was good to eat with the chutney wat they served and peri peri grilled panner was also good enough but there service is too slow because of there less staff The person who takes order will go cook nd come in kitchen as what we observed and staff oly does not whats there in the menu he comes tell after 15mins of order tat drink is not tere nd take other lots of time for the other one
9493,Cafe Ajfan,3,"Nice place in Jayanagar Can be called a Dry fuit cafe as well as they have their own dry fruit store next to the cafe

The grilled Chicken sandwich was okay

Finally to top up had their Ajfan Special shake which is fully loaded with dry fruits Yummy"
9506,Cafe Ajfan,4,Had a wonderful meal here  We had the mustard fish and the lamb chops  The restaurant was empty when we arrived and I was skeptical of the quality  But I was reassured after the food came and really happy with the desert the Arabian Rhapsody  My only complaint was the portion sizes which could have been larger
9507,Cafe Ajfan,4,"Hidden in the quite yet easy to access lanes of Jayanagar this place was surely a surprise When I read the name Ajfan I knew they were into dates and dry fruits when I saw the menu with the Arabic and Mediterranean fusion I said to myself why not give it a try

Food  4 out of 5 whatever we tried except for the Iced ice was good
Value for money  4 out of 5 with Zomato gold
Service  35 out of 5 they constantly checked and cared about our experience"
9508,Cafe Ajfan,3,Had heard a lot about this place But was disappointed as the food and Chai was not as good as suggested by some We ordered sub sandwich and was surprised to see the bread was actually Like a garlic bread kind off that we get in pizza hut
9509,Cafe Ajfan,4,"The latest addition to the list of new eateries in the lane Arabian cuisine amidst Jayanagar Ordered for chicken wings meat was perfectly blended with spices and fried well French fries made me eat the whole pot which my friend had ordered ended the evening with teai could feel the strong traditional taste of tea in mudka pot Ambient lightings Ac premium and classy especially the wooden interiors of walls and floor with house plants Exquisite white and gold marbles designed with a 3d view on the wall and the couch made my evening peace out with my friends after a hectic schedule Hoped that time runs slower as a couple of hours passed in a jiffy

9511,Cafe Ajfan,3.5,"The food here was okay the quality was good but it was bland
I ordered
 cheesy fries  which came with normal fries with little cheese grated on top 

 Margherita pizza  very very very small pizza as per the price 

 Red sauce pasta  quality okay taste a bit bland came with normal triangular bread toast instead of garlic bread

Overall the food was okay  Tasted good with loaded chilli flakes and oregano

9560,SLV Corner Restaurant,4,"SLV is probably the only place that serves a chutney dip I went there with my cousins on a Sunday morning It was packed to the brim with people which was a really good sign We were soon seated and we ordered poori masala dosa idly chutney dip idly sambhar dip vada and vada with sambhar dip

The ambience is pretty basic like a darshini style Its properly ventilated and quite a few people can be seated at a time The service is quick and courteous

The poori was fluffy and not oily It tasted really good with the saagu and chutney The masala dosa was pretty standard If you like very crisp dosas youll like this The idly chutney dip was delectable The chutney was refreshing with the flavour of coriander and coconut

What I didnt quite fancy was the coffee and tea Both of them were very strong and even my cousins felt so

Overall a nice breakfast joint to go with your family
